"1","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+3","The workers who populate this market have been assessed  on dimensions that are universally relevant to understanding whether, why, and when they should be recruited as research participants."
"2","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+4","We discuss the characteristics of MTurk as a participant pool for psychology and other social sciences, highlighting the traits of the MTurk samples, why people become MTurk workers and research participants, and how data quality on MTurk compares to that from other pools and depends on controllable and uncontrollable factors."
"3","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+5","Keywords Mechanical Turk, online experimentation, data collection The Internet has democratized knowledge by lowering barriers to the consumption, dissemination, and creation of knowledge."
"4","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+6","Although social scientists have long relied on the Internet for data collection, difficulties in recruit- ing and compensating participants have inhibited data collection online."
"5","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+7","A Web site called Mechanical Turk (MTurk) has recently offered a solution to these technical challenges."
"6","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+8","MTurk is an online labor market created by Amazon to assist “requesters” in hiring and paying “workers” for the completion of computerized tasks."
"7","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+9","Tasks  (e.g.,  transcrib- ing text) are typically completed within minutes and usu- ally pay in cents rather than dollars."
"8","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+10","Social scientists have recently discovered the potential of the MTurk workforce    as a large pool of participants, constantly available to complete research studies at a low cost."
"9","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+11","Today, it is not uncommon to read empirical articles  that  are  entirely  based on data collected using MTurk."
"10","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+12","With the surge of interest in MTurk as a participant- recruitment tool have come questions regarding its reli- ability."
"11","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+16","Reservations are justified particularly because MTurk is not a participant pool, and it presents researchers with challenges that other pools do not (e.g., how to select participants on the basis of their characteristics)."
"12","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+17","We inte- grate the available evidence that speaks to whether and how researchers can use MTurk as a data-collection tool."
"13","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+18","Characteristics of MTurk Samples Workers choose to complete  MTurk  tasks  for  minimal  pay, which raises questions about who they are and why   they do so."
"14","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+19","Although payment is an important factor, self- reports indicate that workers are driven by both extrinsic  and intrinsic motives (e.g.,  workers  have  reported  that  they complete tasks “to make basic ends meet” and because “tasks are fun”; Paolacci, Chandler, & Ipeirotis, 2010; Ross, Irani, Silberman, Zaldivar,  &  Tomlinson, 2010), which suggests that the rewards of working on  MTurk are not merely monetary."
"15","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+20","In 2014, the MTurk workforce is composed of more than 500,000 individuals from 190 countries."
"16","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+21","Demographic Corresponding Author: Gabriele Paolacci, Department of Marketing Management, Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University Rotterdam, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, 3062 PA Rotterdam, The Netherlands E-mail: gpaolacci@rsm.nl surveys consistently indicate that MTurk is dominated by workers residing in the United States and India, with less than a quarter of workers residing elsewhere (Paolacci et al., 2010; Ross et al., 2010)."
"17","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+22","In general, workers are diverse but not representative of the populations they are drawn from, reflecting that Internet users differ systemati- cally from non-Internet users."
"18","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+23","Workers tend to be younger (about 30 years old), overeducated, underemployed, less religious, and more liberal than the general population (Berinsky, Huber, & Lenz, 2012; Paolacci et al., 2010; Shapiro, Chandler, & Mueller, 2013)."
"19","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+24","Within the United States, Asians are overrepresented and Blacks and Hispanics are underrepresented relative to the popula- tion as a whole (Berinsky et al., 2012)."
"20","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+25","Personality studies have also revealed  differences between workers and other samples that parallel differ- ences between frequent and infrequent Internet users (Shapiro et al., 2013)."
"21","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+26","Worker samples are less extraverted than college-student and community samples (Goodman, Cryder, & Cheema, 2013; Kosara & Ziemkiewicz, 2010) and more socially anxious than the U.S. population at large (Shapiro et al., 2013)."
"22","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+27","There is also some evidence that workers are less emotionally stable (Goodman et al., 2013; Kosara & Ziemkiewicz, 2010), although they are no more likely to display clinically relevant emotional disreg- ulation than the general population (Shapiro et al., 2013)."
"23","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+28","Less is known about workers’ cognitive abilities, and this remains a fruitful area of investigation."
"24","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+29","Paolacci and colleagues (2010) found no difference between workers, undergraduates, and other Internet users on a self-report measure of numeracy that correlates highly with actual quantitative abilities."
"25","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+30","However, workers may learn more slowly and have more difficulty with complex tasks than university students, perhaps reflecting differences in age and education (Crump, McDonnell, & Gureckis, 2013)."
"26","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+32","It can replace or supplement traditional conve- nience samples, but it should not be treated as represen- tative of the general population."
"27","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+33","The sheer size of the MTurk workforce and the possibility to selectively recruit workers (described below) can also make it useful  to reach samples with specific characteristics."
"28","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+34","Sampling Issues on MTurk Workers select the tasks they wish to perform from a  large number of available alternatives."
"29","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+35","Importantly, work- ers are not necessarily qualified to complete all tasks."
"30","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+36","Requesters can decide who can and cannot participate in  a task by requiring workers to possess “qualifications” that are assigned by MTurk (e.g., country of residence, ratio of approved to submitted tasks) or by requesters themselves (e.g., on the basis of information obtained in   a prior study; J."
"31","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+38","Researchers can thus intentionally or inadvertently con- struct samples that are not representative of the worker population."
"32","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+39","How do workers choose among tasks for which they are qualified?"
"33","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+40","By default, tasks are sorted according to how recently they were posted, and recency is a major determinant of participation (Chilton, Horton, Miller, & Azenkot, 2010)."
"34","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+41","Workers can sort tasks according to addi- tional criteria, including keywords and  payments."
"35","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+42","Whereas few workers use keywords to find tasks (Chilton et al., 2010), more lucrative tasks are consistently more attractive (e.g., Buhrmester, Kwang, & Gosling, 2011; Mason & Watts, 2009)."
"36","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+43","Interestingly, workers appear to be sensitive to nominal pay rates, finding tasks that pay in multiples of 5 cents to be more attractive (Horton & Chilton, 2010)."
"37","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+44","The importance of recency and compen- sation means that participation peaks early and declines rapidly, and that researchers might acquire large samples more quickly by posting the task more than once or pay- ing workers more."
"38","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+45","Other factors affect the likelihood of workers’ seeing and selecting a task and influence the sample composi- tion, including task complexity (Kazai, Kamps, & Milic- Frayling, 2012), time of sampling (Komarov, Reinecke, & Gajos, 2013), and whether the task was discussed in an online forum ( J."
"39","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+47","Much remains to be learned about the factors that influ- ence sample composition, but these findings underscore the need to collect and report sample characteristics  rather than assume they are similar to those of earlier research studies, and caution against assuming that single studies will replicate within other MTurk samples."
"40","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+48","The fact that workers are free to select what to work on and how much work to complete raises the concern that they participate in studies that employ procedures they have seen already."
"41","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+49","Researchers can be “followed” by work- ers who find their tasks lucrative and interesting, and the high rate at which researchers seem to post non-novel tasks on MTurk is unlikely to be matched by the rate at which new individuals join the workforce."
"42","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+50","We found evi- dence in our requester history that about 10% of workers are responsible for completing 41% of tasks, and that more experienced workers are more familiar with classic para- digms within behavioral sciences (e.g., trolley problems used in moral dilemmas: J."
"43","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+51","Chandler, Mueller, & Paolacci, 2014; see also Fort, Adda, & Cohen, 2011), which suggests that their prior experiences may influence their responses in research studies."
"44","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+52","Indeed, there is evidence that practice effects influence measures assumed to reflect individual differences."
"45","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+53","Worker productivity correlates with perfor- mance on a popular test of reflexivity but not with perfor- mance on a novel but logically identical test ( J."
"46","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+54","Chandler, Mueller, & Paolacci, 2014), and Rand and colleagues (in press) found that workers’ “intuitive” preference for cooperation declined with workers’  experience but reemerged when assessed with a novel instrument."
"47","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+55","These effects can result from processing advantages gained by prior exposure to materials and the ability to draw on prior answers when forming a response."
"48","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+56","Importantly, practice effects do not generalize from specific to logically equiva- lent procedures, which suggests that these concerns can  be avoided by developing and using novel research para- digms and excluding prior participants using qualifications or other methods ( J."
"49","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+58","If this is not possible, researchers should consider avoiding MTurk samples."
"50","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+59","(Baseline) Data Quality Although data quality can be defined in several ways, research assessing MTurk on dimensions universally rele- vant to researchers supports the idea that worker  samples  are reliable."
"51","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+60","Self-reports of individual differences are psy- chometrically valid (Buhrmester et al., 2011; Shapiro et al., 2013), and the quality of linguistic judgments respondents provide is comparable to that of college samples (Sprouse, 2011)."
"52","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+61","Workers exhibit the same cognitive biases (e.g., framing effects), logical fallacies (e.g., conjunction fallacy), and behavior in economic games  as  traditional  partici-  pants do (e.g., Amir, Rand, & Gal, 2012; Goodman et al., 2013; Horton, Rand, & Zeckhauser, 2011; Klein et al., 2014; Paolacci et al., 2010)."
"53","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+62","Classic cognitive tasks that rely on response-time measures have also been replicated,  includ- ing Stroop, switching, flanker, attentional blink, and sub- liminal-priming tasks (Crump et al., 2013)."
"54","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+63","The primary limiting feature in these experiments is the technical qual-  ity of users’ computers (i.e., the refresh rate of computer monitors) rather than noise induced by inattentive or dis- tracted participants (Simcox & Fiez, 2014)."
"55","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+64","Monitoring Web participants is hard, and a natural concern is whether MTurk participants are conscientious and honest."
"56","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+65","In addition to the successful replication of attention-sensitive tasks, direct assessments of attentive- ness revealed few differences between MTurk workers and other participants (e.g., Berinsky, Margolis, & Sances, in press; Paolacci et al., 2010)."
"57","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+66","Workers also appear to be truthful when providing self-report information."
"58","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+67","Respondents’ reported location typically matches their IP address (e.g., Rand, 2012; Shapiro et al., 2013), and there is remarkable consistency over time in workers’ demo- graphic  characteristics  (e.g.,   age   and   gender   after   6 months: Mason & Suri, 2012) and individual-difference measures (after 1 week: Shapiro et al., 2013; and after 3 weeks: Buhrmester et al., 2011; Holden, Dennie, & Hicks, 2013)."
"59","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+68","Indirect comparisons do not support suspi- cions that MTurk workers are more likely to cheat than members of college samples (Suri, Goldstein, & Mason, 2011),  although  the  fact  that  workers  do  respond to incentives to cheat (Goodman et al., 2013) cautions against conducting studies on MTurk that provide partici- pants with opportunities to exploit the uncontrollability of the online environment."
"60","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+69","In sum, researchers can use MTurk for virtually any study that is feasible to conduct online."
"61","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+70","Workers are dili- gent because of their intrinsic motivations and the incen- tive structure of MTurk: Requesters are not forced to approve submissions and can screen workers on the basis of past approval rates."
"62","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+71","Although the desire to provide quality responses is usually beneficial, it may also lead to unintended conse- quences."
"63","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+72","MTurk workers seem to score higher in social desirability (Behrend, Sharek, Meade, & Wiebe, 2011), are unusually likely to report rare symptoms that appear clinically relevant (Shapiro et al., 2013), and may search the Internet for the answers to factually verifiable ques- tions (Goodman et al., 2013)."
"64","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+73","This suggests that workers are motivated to please requesters, and it highlights the importance of taking measures to avoid demand effects by concealing the research question of interest, tempo- rally separating prescreening measures from the depen- dent variables of interest, and using between-subjects experimental manipulations."
"65","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+74","Determinants of Data Quality Data quality on MTurk is good, but it is also variable."
"66","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+76","Indeed, payment improves performance on tasks with factually correct answers that can be determined through additional effort (Aker, El-Haj, Albakour, & Kruschwitz, 2012) and reduces random responses (Kazai, 2010)."
"67","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+77","However, for tasks that rely on subjective responses, as most psychology studies do, there is no relationship between pay rates and quality (Buhrmester et al., 2011; Marge, Banerjee, & Rudnicky, 2010; Mason & Watts, 2009)."
"68","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+78","In these cases, true responses likely require no more effort than false responses, and the limiting factor is more likely to be workers’ understanding of the task (e.g., language comprehension; Goodman et al., 2013), which cannot be reduced by paying more."
"69","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+79","Researchers who use MTurk often “improve” data quality by using screening methods that exclude prob- lematic observations ex post ( J."
"70","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+81","There  are  multiple  reasons  to  avoid using ex post screening methods, particularly  those  that  flag inattentive participants using one or a small number     of questions."
"71","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+82","These  have  high  measurement  error,  rely  on the questionable assumption that measured attentive-  ness is constant throughout the task, and may tap into correlated traits rather than state-level differences in attentiveness (Berinsky et al.,  in  press),  sacrificing  sam- ple diversity."
"72","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+83","There is also no evidence that attention checks improve data quality above and beyond simply recruiting workers with a high approval rate (Peer, Vosgerau, & Acquisti, 2013)."
"73","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+84","Attention may vary even within conscientious work- ers, and researchers may want to induce attentiveness ex ante by including tasks that signal to workers that their subsequent responses will be scrutinized (e.g., tasks in which participants must answer factually verifiable ques- tions; Heer & Bostock, 2010; Kittur, Chi, & Suh, 2008) or require commitment (Rand, Greene, & Nowak, 2012)."
"74","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+85","Performance-contingent bonuses increase passing rates on factual manipulation checks, perhaps by signaling that certain information should be attended to ( J."
"75","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+87","Moreover, consistent with the importance of intrinsic motivation among workers, data quality can be increased by embedding tasks with “mean- ing.”"
"76","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+88","Thanking workers and explaining to them the mean- ing of the task they will complete can stimulate better work (D."
"77","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+89","Chandler & Kapelner, 2013), as does framing a task as requested by a nonprofit organization (Rogstadius et al., 2011)."
"78","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+90","Conclusions MTurk has accelerated and democratized science by facilitating access to a heterogeneous research-partici- pant pool and has provided scientists with a platform to conduct research that is hard to conduct within physical labs or elsewhere online, such as studies of the real-time dynamics of large groups (e.g., Mason & Watts, 2012), cross-cultural comparisons (between the United States  and India; Eriksson & Simpson, 2010), longitudinal stud- ies (e.g., Berinsky et al., 2012), and field experiments (D."
"79","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+92","These technical advantages are compelling, but researchers should use MTurk with care."
"80","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+93","While more diverse than college samples, workers (like Internet users) are not a representative sample, and sample composition varies dynamically."
"81","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+94","The potential for arbitrary design choices to influence sample composition suggests that researchers should be transparent in the materials used in their studies and the methods used to recruit and exclude participants."
"82","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+95","The low cost of MTurk data facilitates the col- lection of well-powered samples that, ceteris paribus, bet- ter reflect the available workforce."
"83","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+96","Further, tools exist to recruit desired workers (e.g., those who are attentive and produce quality work) and avoid undesired workers (e.g., those who are known to have participated in similar stud- ies in the past), allowing further control over the final sam- ple."
"84","Inside the Turk- Understanding Mechanical Turk as a Participant Pool_2014_A+97","Finally, important questions remain unanswered about the cognitive profile of workers at large; the specifics of how prior experience, community norms, and other fac- tors influence survey response; and how sampling deci- sions (e.g., when the task is posted and how it is described) influence the characteristics of MTurk samples."

"452","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+400","We hypoth- esized (H2) that those higher in ONS would provide more exact EV responses compared with those lower in ONS and (H4) that individuals with more exact mappings would provide valuations less distant from the EV relative to those with less exact mappings."
"453","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+401","In addition, ONS should also be associated with distance from the EV because high-ONS individuals are expected to provide exact EV valuations (distance = 0)."
"454","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+402","Analysis of an SEM of the summed z-scores of the absolute distances from the EV revealed that individuals higher versus lower in ONS provided values closer to the EV (b = —.14, SE = .043, þ= —.30, p < .01; mean summed distance = .51 and .83, respectively, for those higher and lower in ONS)."
"455","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+403","In addition and as in H4, individuals with more exact mappings of symbolic numbers also provided values closer to the EV (b =  —.09, SE = .043, þ = —.19, p = .04) than those with less exact mappings."
"456","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+404","Mean summed absolute distances from the EVs were .57 and .84, respectively, for those with more and less exact SMap."
"457","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+405","Working memory, vocabulary, and SNS were not significant predictors and were removed from the model."
"458","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+406","The final model with ONS and SMap fit the data well (GFI = .97, CFI = .99, y2[11] = 11.3, p = .42, y2/df = 1.03, RMSEA = .02)."
"459","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+408","Because ONS and SMap both significantly predicted absolute distances from the gamble EVs, we were interested in whether participants high versus low in ONS and high versus low in SMap used the same type of strategies to achieve values closer to the EV."
"460","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+409","Our hypothesis (H2) was that higher ONS would be related to calculating the exact EV more often, whereas SMap scores would be associated with approximated valuations (H3), which create numbers close to the EV without exactly matching the EV."
"461","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+410","Because most participants did not choose exactly the EV (participants provided the EV an average of 0.55 times out of the four gambles), the EV count variable did not satisfy the normality criterion for parametric statistics; as a result, we calculated Spearman’s correlations."
"462","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+411","For each numeric compe- tency, we first regressed it onto the other two competencies, working memory and vocabulary, in order to remove any shared variance."
"463","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+412","We then calculated correlations between each residu- alized competency measure and the EV count variable."
"464","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+413","On the basis of this analysis, high-ONS individuals provided margin- ally more valuations equal to the expected value than low-ONS individuals (rs = .18, n = 108, p = .08; the mean number of times the EV was provided was .87 and .28, respectively, for those individuals higher and lower in ONS)."
"465","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+414","As expected, SMap scores were not associated with providing more valuations  equal to the EV (rs = —.06, n = 108, p = .56), nor were SNS scores (rs = .15, n = 108, p = .12), vocabulary (rs=—.01, p = .91), or working memory (rs=—.08, p = .42)."
"466","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+415","To examine more closely those participants who calculated EVs, we coded each individual on the basis of whether they gave the exact EV for all four gambles (3.7% did so) and used logistic regression."
"467","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+416","The results revealed that only higher ONS (B = 2.01, SE = 1.09, Wald’s y2 = 3.72, p = .05) was associated with giving the exact EV all four times when controlling for SNS, SMap, vocabulary, and working memory."
"468","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+417","After removing nonsignificant predictors one at a time, the final model included only ONS (B = 1.79, SE = 0.79, Wald’s y2 = 5.13, p = .02), was significant   (y2 = 7.92, df = 1, p = .005), and predicted 96% of the responses correctly (Cox & Snell R2 = .07, Nagelkerje R2 = .26)."
"469","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+418","Consistent with H2, individuals higher in ONS appeared to perform number operations (calculating EVs) more than those lower in ONS (the proportion who gave the exact EV all four times was 8.3% and 0%, respectively)."
"470","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+420","General Discussion Unlike the careful distinctions that have been made between Openness/Intellect and general intelligence, a great deal of research in numeracy treats its multiple facets as interchange- able (e.g., Rolison et al., 2013)."

"474","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+425","These findings were consistent with prior research that had concluded that subjective measures such as the SNS are poor diagnostic indicators of ONS (e.g., Nelson et al., 2013)."
"475","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+426","In the present article, we proposed a model of the relations between these multiple numeric competencies that fit the data well."
"476","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+427","In particular and consistent with prior developmental research (e.g., Booth & Siegler, 2008), we modeled more exact mappings of symbolic numbers to magnitude representations (SMap) as leading to greater objective numeracy."
"477","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+428","General intelligence (assessed with working memory and vocabulary) did not add significant predic- tive power to objective numeracy."
"478","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+429","This result was surprising given that general intelligence includes objective numeracy, but it may be due to the brevity of the ONS scale and its less than perfect reliability and construct validity."
"479","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+430","More objective numeracy led, in turn, to greater subjective numeracy and more positive math emo- tions."
"480","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+431","Reversing the direction of the path between subjective numeracy and math emotions (so that greater subjective numeracy led to more positive math emotions) did not alter the model fit."
"481","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+432","As a result, we cannot draw conclusions about this path’s direction."
"482","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+434","In our final model, more positive math emotions were a stronger predictor of subjective numeracy than was objective numeracy."
"483","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+435","These findings supported our hypothesis (H3) that SNS would be associated with emotional reactions to numbers and further ques- tioned the use of SNS as an ONS proxy."
"484","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+436","Numbers can be fraught with emotion even among more numerate individuals, and these emotions correlate strongly with a subjective sense of one’s ability."
"485","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+437","In addition, we retained gender as a predictor of both objective and subjective numeric ability because women are often reported as scoring lower than men on objective numeracy scales (Reyna et al., 2009) and higher than men in self-reported math anxiety (Betz, 1978)."
"486","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+438","In our study, the influence of gender on ONS was only marginally significant after controlling for the influences of SMap and intelligence proxies."
"487","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+439","Females did, however, rate themselves as subjectively less numerate than males."
"488","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+440","It may be that lower sub- jective numeracy and greater math anxiety (e.g., Betz, 1978) are the more proximal mechanisms for the gender gap in math that is often found, at least on more difficult tests (Stoet & Geary, 2012)."
"489","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+441","If true, different approaches may be required for reducing this gap."
"490","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+442","Instead of focusing primarily on more math education, the focus might turn to aspects of early instruction that appear quite func- tional in most individuals but exacerbate math anxiety in some currently disadvantaged groups (e.g., females, minorities, lower socioeconomic status individuals)."
"491","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+443","Alternatively, it may be that affirming important values is a solution (at least among women who hold a negative stereotype of women and math)."
"492","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+444","Self- affirmation has led to increases in math performance among women who held the negative gender math stereotype in some studies (e.g., Martens et al., 2006)."
"493","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+445","A recent review, however, concluded that stereotype threat may not be the primary causal factor in the gender gap in mathematics (Stoet & Geary, 2012)."
"494","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+446","Instead, they suggest other avenues for research (e.g., gender differences in three-dimensional spatial cognition)."
"495","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+447","Inconsistent with these proposed more proximal mechanisms of math anxiety and subjective numeracy, however, an alternative model (in which female gender predicted lower SNS, lower SNS predicted lower ONS and less positive math emotions, and less positive math emotions led to lower ONS) was not as good a fit to the data, nor were other variants on this alternative model."
"496","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+448","It may be that feedback loops (e.g., a bidirectional path between SNS and ONS) exist even though they cannot be tested in our SEM."
"497","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+449","Alter- natively, the significance and even the direction of these paths may change across development."
"498","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+450","For example, female primary-school students assigned to a female teacher without a strong math back- ground scored lower in math but not in reading than those assigned to a female teacher with a strong math background; male students did not suffer the same effect (Antecol, Eren, & Ozbeklik, 2012)."
"499","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+451","They suggest the results are due to female students internalizing their teacher’s math anxiety in ways that subsequently influence their math scores (Lyons & Beilock, 2012)."
"500","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+452","The accuracy of self-perceived numeracy also may improve with age and feedback (a stronger correlation between SNS and ONS would emerge), but such a change could leave the path between math emotions and ONS untouched."
"501","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+453","Research on developmental changes in these constructs is needed."
"502","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+454","Self-affirmation manipulations could have effects on ONS through either SNS or math emotions."
"503","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+456","Similarly, reversing only Path 2 so that SNS predicted ONS and dropping Path 3 between ONS and math emotions was not a good fit to the data."
"504","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+457","These results beg the question of why stereo- type threat reduction among college students attenuates gender’s influence on objective numeracy."
"505","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+458","Other mediating psychological processes may be critical, for which we do not have data (e.g., cognitive load, arousal, suppression, and with analyses conducted only in the threatened group; Martens et al., 2006)."
"506","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+459","In terms of other aspects of personality, it seems likely that future research will reveal that the numeric competencies relate positively to both Openness/Intellect and need for cognition (DeYoung et al., 2007; Peters & Levin, 2008)."
"507","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+460","In particular, the numeric competencies can be considered more specific facets of the Openness/Intellect factor, with subjective numeracy as self- perceived numeric intelligence (similar to Intellect being self- perceived intelligence), objective numeracy as a learned intelli- gence, and the mapping of symbolic numbers as a more innate intelligence and perhaps connected more with Openness and en- gagement with perceptual and sensory information as opposed to Intellect (see DeYoung, 2014)."

"513","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+466","Some prior research has examined the separable decision effects of objective numeracy and SMap (or a related measure) on valuation and proportional reasoning (Peters et al., 2008; Schley & Peters, 2014)."
"514","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+467","To our knowledge, prior studies have neither devel- oped theoretical predictions for nor investigated the separable relations of all three numeric competencies to performance in a diverse set of numeric and nonnumeric tasks when controlling for each other and general intelligence proxies."
"515","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+469","In the present results and consistent with our hypotheses, clear distinctions emerged among the numeric competencies."
"516","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+470","We hypothesized (H2) and found that higher versus lower scores in objective numeracy were associated with conducting more explicit number opera- tions—number comparisons and calculations—in tasks."
"517","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+471","In partic- ular, higher versus lower ONS individuals appeared more likely to perform a simple number operation, comparing a small loss with an amount to win; they paradoxically proceeded to rate an objec- tively worse bet as subjectively more attractive than an objectively better bet that did not involve the small loss."
"518","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+472","The effect was independent of subjective numeracy, SMap, and intelligence prox- ies."
"519","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+473","Those higher in objective numeracy were also more likely to perform a complex number operation; they provided more exact EV amounts when valuing gambles compared with those lower in objective numeracy."
"520","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+474","No other numeric competency was associated significantly with this more complex calculation process."
"521","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+475","These results run counter to earlier ones from Cokely and Kelley (2009), who found that individuals higher in objective numeracy made more choices consistent with EV than did the less numerate, but without reporting more EV calculations."
"522","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+476","Instead, objective numeracy’s relation with choice was mediated by the number of simple (often number-related) considerations made (e.g., number comparisons, “$900 is a lot more than $125”; probability trans- formations, 20% chance to win equals 80% to not win)."
"523","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+477","The difference in results between our study and theirs may be due to the different methods used."
"524","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+478","In our study, participants provided      a specific value; Cokely and Kelley’s participants instead made a series of one-shot choices between an amount for sure and a gamble."
"525","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+480","In addition, our participants made a series of scaled preferences first between a gamble and an amount to win for sure that in- creased gradually as the participant proceeded down the page; at the bottom of the page, the participant was asked to provide the amount for sure equivalent to the gamble."
"526","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+481","This method may have resulted in our participants focusing more than theirs on EV."
"527","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+482","Alternatively, verbal protocols (used by Cokely & Kelly) are inherently problematic and may not be the best method for deter- mining numeric operations used."
"528","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+483","It may be that their participants simply did not remember or report this calculation process in retrospect because the load of repeated choices and the subsequent requirement to verbalize caused participants to simplify their re- ports."
"529","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+484","Participants also may have had a difficult time verbalizing very simple numerical processes that were more or less automatic (e.g., one half of the sum of 60 plus 40 equals 50; however, the fact that they reported simple probability transformations argues against this possibility)."
"530","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+485","Additional studies should explore how objective numeracy influences which number operations are used in decisions and how characteristics of the situation (e.g., time pressure, task importance) influence the use of explicit number operations through objective numeracy versus numeric estimations through SMap."

"532","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+487","The relatively large correlation be- tween SNS and ONS (r = .46) suggests that SNS may adequately capture the ONS construct."
"533","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+488","However, of our three tasks, SNS appeared an adequate proxy in only one task, risky-gambles val- uation."
"534","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+489","In it, both SNS and ONS correlated significantly with the measure of EV distance (the absolute difference between the participant’s valuation and the gamble’s EV)."
"535","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+490","Although the SEM revealed that ONS had a stronger relation with this dependent measure, SNS nonetheless may be adequate."
"536","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+491","In the remaining tasks (bets and numeric memory), SNS and ONS had more separate influences on performance, and using SNS as an ONS proxy did not appear adequate."
"537","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+492","Instead, individuals lower in subjective numeracy appeared to be less motivated and/or confident in number-related tasks compared with those higher in subjective numeracy (controlling for objective ability)."
"538","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+493","First, lower SNS individuals rated both the loss and no-loss bets as less attractive than those higher in SNS; the presence versus absence of the loss had no significant impact (whereas condition did matter in interaction with ONS)."
"539","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+494","Second, the memory task results revealed that those higher versus lower in SNS were more likely to respond."
"540","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+495","Presumably, high-SNS individuals were more comfortable and/or confident in guessing."
"541","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+496","Neither ONS nor SMap significantly related to guessing after controlling for other predictors."
"542","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+497","Although we expected greater SNS to relate to more guessing only in the numeric portion of the task, it was also associated with more guessing of objects."
"543","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+498","This unexpected result may have been due to the need to bind numbers and objects with locations in the task, thus influencing performance on object memory as well."
"544","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+499","We conducted a further exploratory test of our hypothesis using non- responses (guessing) in the vocabulary task; here, SNS was not significantly related to guessing."
"545","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+500","This result suggests that the previous SNS– object memory results might have been due to the required binding of  nonnumeric  and  numeric  information  in the task."
"546","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+502","SMap related to number memory as expected without having any particular relation with object memory, and higher SNS was also marginally associated with greater self-reported health, indicating a possible bias toward more positive responses."
"547","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+503","Higher SNS scores continued to predict greater bet attractiveness, however, after con- trolling for the possibility of a more positive general response tendency presumably reflected in the health ratings."
"548","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+504","It is possible, nonetheless, that SNS will relate to a variety of numeric and nonnumeric emotions, motivations, and metacognitions simply because it is self-evaluative (Dunning et al., 2004)."
"549","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+505","Thus, although we predicted that SNS would relate more to numeric than nonnumeric task performance, the present results are somewhat unclear."
"550","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+506","SNS may have captured more general affective This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.experience and motivational and/or metacognitive factors as well."
"551","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+507","We speculate that these same findings could emerge due to pre- existing more positive (vs. less positive) mood states."
"552","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+508","These more positive mood states, then, might relate to reporting oneself as being higher in subjective numeracy, having more positive emo- tions about math, rating bets as more attractive and oneself as healthier, and being more motivated and confident to guess on the memory task."
"553","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+509","Thus, it is plausible that those with greater SNS simply rated all objects more positively based on a mood-as- information mechanism that guides judgments (Schwarz & Clore, 1983)."
"554","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+510","This speculation is inconsistent, however, with the lack of association between SNS and nonresponses on the vocabulary task."
"555","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+512","Alternatively, the results may be more consistent with research on the self that assumes a more global and unitary sense of the self that directs perceptions and actions more generally rather than a subset of self-knowledge (e.g., subjective numeracy) being activated and directing more specific perceptions and actions (McConnell, 2011)."
"556","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+513","Thus, a more positive sense of self would produce both higher SNS and greater motivations and metacognitions across tasks."
"557","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+514","If true, however, any general increase in motivation should drive better performance across all of the measures used, including the intelligence proxies."
"558","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+515","The data, however, were inconsistent with this possibility because the numeric competencies have different predictive power in tasks than each other and the intelligence proxies in ways that make sense based on theory and past data."

"562","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+519","As a result, individuals with greater subjective numeracy may be more likely to perceive number-heavy decision tasks in their everyday lives as more worthwhile, and they may approach them with more confidence than those lower in subjective nu- meracy."
"563","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+520","Thus, high-SNS individuals may be more likely to com- plete such tasks."

"565","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+522","Given prior research on the importance of affect and gist to decision quality (Reyna et al., 2009; Slovic & Peters, 2006), it may be that more intuitive and emotional ways of knowing numbers (SMap and SNS) are ulti- mately more important to life outcomes than deliberative ways of knowing them (ONS)."
"566","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+523","Having high SNS may be enough to attain the gist of numeric information needed for high-quality decisions; the verbatim information processed through objective numeracy may be wasted thought (Reyna, 2004)."
"567","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+524","No studies have examined the possible separate impacts of ONS and SNS on such life outcomes thus far."
"568","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+525","In addition, experimental manipulations are needed of each numeric competency to examine causal effects."
"569","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+526","One question, for example, would be whether manipulating one’s subjective nu- meracy would have an impact on emotions toward numeric tasks, motivational aspects of performance in them, confidence in pro- vided numeric information, and/or the likelihood of performing number operations."
"570","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+527","Such an experimental manipulation also brings up the question about the stability of subjective numeracy over time and context; little is known."
"571","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+528","For example, does failure on a numeric task have any impact on self-impressions of math skill, and, if so, for how long?"
"572","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+529","Similarly, the developmental progression of subjective numeracy has not been examined."
"573","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+530","Does a subjective sense of numeracy emerge as a product of top-down processes (e.g., cultural knowledge and stereotypes) or of bottom-up pro- cesses that concern individual experiences?"
"574","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+531","In the present data, we found no evidence of interactions between subjective and objective numeracy in predicting task performance, but it seems logical that someone who is good with numbers but lacks the motivation to use them (or even has negative emotions toward them) might not bring his or her objective numeracy skills to bear on tasks."
"575","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+532","The lack of   a strong association between SNS and ONS also suggests that it may be useful to study discrepancies between the two constructs."
"576","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+533","For example, is having a high sense of one’s own numeracy while having only marginal objective numeracy evidence of a defensive process that carries physiological and decision quality costs, or is it evidence of positive illusions that protect against the biological costs of dealing with numeric information in our information-rich society (Taylor, Lerner, Sherman, Sage, & McDowell, 2003)?"
"577","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+535","The present data highlight the fact that subjective numeracy scores can capture motivational and emotional relations a person has with numbers and their use."

"581","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+539","Those with more versus less exact mapping had better numeric memory (but not nonnumeric memory); neither objective nor subjective numeracy had similar effects."
"582","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+540","This result extends (into adult individual differences) earlier findings of a developmental trajectory of more exact mappings and superior numeric memory among children (Thompson & Siegler, 2010)."
"583","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+541","In addition, partic- ipants with more versus less exact mapping produced valuations of risky gambles that were closer to (but did not equal) a risky gamble’s EV, indicating superior number intuitions rather than any explicit number operation (higher ONS was associated with an explicit number operation)."
"584","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+542","Our findings may be due to more exact mental magnitude representations that produce both more precise and accessible numeric memory representations and the ability to perform approximate mathematical operations on nonsymbolic quantities more effectively (Barth et al., 2006)."
"585","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+543","A question arising from the developmental literature concerns the extent to which mapping tasks (e.g., the current number line task) reflect mental magnitude representations (Chesney & Mat- thews, 2013; Rips, 2013)."
"586","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+544","Whereas conventional mental magnitude representation measures involve quick discrimination of nonsym- bolic magnitudes (e.g., Are there more blue or yellow dots?"
"587","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+545","Hal- berda & Feigenson, 2008), the number line task also requires the mapping of symbolic numbers to those mental magnitudes."
"588","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+546","Thus, results in the present studies may be determined by exactness in mental magnitude representations, the mapping of symbolic num- ber to mental magnitudes, or a combination of both processes."

"594","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+552","It may be, for example, that high-SMap individuals are quite good at roughly estimating totals (e.g., monthly purchases on credit cards); low-SMap individuals, who may not estimate as well, instead may be surprised by monthly bills that are much lower (or higher) than expected."

"598","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+556","Numeracy has been related to attentional biases in processing risk information, with those individuals higher in objective numeracy attending more to numeric information than those lower in objec- tive numeracy (Keller, 2011)."

"607","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+567","Conclusions The three numeric competencies have all been called “nu- meracy,” but they appear instead to be related constructs with different influences on the processing and use of numbers."
"608","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+568","Objec- tive numeracy (ONS) seems to drive the use of explicit number operations, including number comparisons and the use of logical number-related algorithms (e.g., calculating an EV), perhaps be- cause those higher in objective numeracy are more able to do the operations, have an affinity for them, or find them less effortful."
"609","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+569","The results with subjective numeracy were somewhat less clear, but SNS scores appeared related more to motivations, emotions, and confidence involving the use and nonuse of numbers."
"610","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+570","The mapping of symbolic numbers to internal magnitude representa- tions (SMap) appeared to concern abilities to distinguish between symbolic numeric magnitudes in ways that influence approximate valuation and the encoding and/or retrieval of numeric information from memory."
"611","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+571","Future research should examine the influence of these numeric competencies on different types of evaluations and choices as well as the quality-of-life outcomes."
"612","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+572","An important caveat for objective numeracy is that performance on logically identical problems may depend somewhat on domain."

"614","Multiple numeric competencies- When a number is not just a number_2015_A+574","Furthermore, Sternberg (1999) reported differences be- tween academic intelligence (similar to what we have measured in the present article) and practical intelligence (that perhaps matters more in real-life judgment and decision making)."

"773","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+3","On the surface, the tasks in the four studies appear to be widely different; at a conceptual level, however, they all involve processing numbers and the potential to show an inﬂuence of affect."
"774","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+4","Findings were consistent with highly numerate individuals being more likely to retrieve and use appro- priate numerical principles, thus making themselves less susceptible to framing effects, compared with less numer- ate individuals."
"775","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+5","In addition, the highly numerate tended  to draw different (generally stronger or more precise) affective meaning from numbers and numerical compari- sons, and their affective responses were more precise."

"779","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+9","Numerical ability appears to matter to judgments and decisions in important ways."
"780","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+10","Although many judgments and decisions rely heavily on un- derstanding basic mathematical concepts, little research has examined the role of numerical ability, or numeracy, in decision tasks."
"781","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+11","Numeracy is deﬁned as the ability to process basic probability and numerical concepts."
"782","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+12","Making good decisions in the real world requires some numerical ability."

"785","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+15","Paulos (1988) argued that the inability to deal ‘‘rationally’’ with small likelihoods of large outcomes (e.g., a highly unlikely but catastrophic outbreak of a disease) results in misinformed government policies, confused personal decisions, and an increased susceptibility to pseudo- science."
"786","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+16","Recent research in numeracy (e.g., Lipkus, Samsa, & Rimer, 2001; Woloshin, Schwartz, Black, & Welch, 1999) sug- gests that people differ substantially in numerical ability and that many people are ‘‘innumerate’’ (Paulos, 1988)."

"790","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+20","We suggest that some of the best-known effects in judgment and decision research, such as framing effects, may result particularly from those participants who are least likely to apply these numerical principles."
"791","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+21","Studies 1 and 2 examined the hypothesis that the framing of numerical information has greater effects on the less numerate than the highly numerate."

"811","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+52","To the best of our knowledge, no studies have examined the effects of actual number performance on the inﬂuence of frames, and especially attribute frames."
"812","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+53","Method Participants (N 5 100, 45% female, mean age 5 26) were recruited using a campus newspaper and were paid $10."
"813","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+56","The framing of exam scores was manipulated between subjects; the scores were presented in terms of either the percentage correct or the percentage incorrect, so that ‘‘Emily,’’ for example, was de- scribed as receiving either 74% correct or 26% incorrect on her exam."
"814","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+57","We predicted that the difference in ratings between the positive- and negative-frame conditions would be greatest among the least numerate individuals."
"815","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+58","This study was administered as part of a series of paper-and- pencil experiments, with the numeracy measure and demo- graphic items presented last."
"816","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+59","This same order (decision tasks, numeracy measure, and demographic items) was used for all the studies reported in this article."
"817","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+61","Because the distribution was highly skewed, we performed a median split on the measure."
"818","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+62","Note that the results for the numeracy measure were similar in Studies 2 through 4, and we used a median split for analyses in those studies as well (sample sizes were small in two of our studies, making quartile and other splits less viable)."
"819","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+63","Thus, our analyses compared the participants who were most numerate (9, 10, or 11 correct) with those who were less numerate (2–8 items correct)."
"820","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+64","Although we recognize that dichotomous splits are associated with problems such as loss of power, the skewness in the variable justiﬁes our choice (MacCallum, Zhang, Preacher, & Rucker, 2002)."
"821","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+65","Results with quartile splits of numeracy were similar to those with median splits in Studies 1 and 4, which had the largest sample sizes."
"822","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+66","In a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the performance ratings, the usual framing effect was found."
"823","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+67","The more positive frame elicited more positive ratings: Mean per- formance ratings were 0.7 and —0.1 for the percentage-correct (positive) and percentage-incorrect (negative) frames, respec- tively, F(1, 96) 5 26.3, p < .0001, Z2 5 .54."
"824","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+69","The interaction of numeracy with frame, however, was significant, F(1, 96) 5 5.6, p < .05, Z2 5 .11."
"825","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+72","This ﬁnding is consistent with the highly numerate being 1A numeracy quartile split showed a stronger framing effect among the less numerate."

"830","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+83","We propose, however, that the likelihood of such appli- cation increases with numeracy, so that the highly numerate should ﬁnd alternative frames of the same number more equally inﬂuential in judgments compared with the less numerate."
"831","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+84","In Study 2, we tested this hypothesis using a paradigm developed by Slovic, Monahan, and MacGregor (2000)."
"832","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+85","They conducted studies in which experienced forensic psychologists and psy- chiatrists were asked to judge the likelihood that a mental pa- tient would commit an act of violence."
"833","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+86","Clinicians told that ‘‘20 out of every 100’’ similar patients would likely commit an act of violence (a frequency frame) were more likely to refuse to dis- charge the patient than were clinicians told that the patient had a ‘‘20% chance’’ of committing an act of violence (a percentage frame)."
"834","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+87","We hypothesized that highly numerate participants, presented with a scenario similar to that used by Slovic et al. (2002), would be more likely than less numerate participants to retrieve the appropriate numerical principle and transform numbers from one format to another (i.e., 20 out of 100 5 20%)."
"835","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+88","Thus, we expected that the format of presentation would affect judgments less among the more numerate than among the less numerate."
"836","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+89","Method Participants were 46 volunteers from a psychology course who read the mental-patient scenario in either a frequency format (‘‘Of every 100 patients similar to Mr."
"837","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+90","Jones, 10 are estimated to commit an act of violence to others during the ﬁrst several months after discharge’’) or a percentage format that used the identical wording but substituted ‘‘10% are estimated’’ for ‘‘10 are estimated.’’"
"838","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+93","They also responded to the same numeracy and de- mographic items used in Study 1."
"839","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+94","In addition, they reported their verbal and quantitative SAT scores, which served as a proxy measure for intelligence."

"843","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+99","Is the numeracy effect due to intelligence rather than nu- meracy per se?"
"844","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+100","Using SAT scores as a proxy for intelligence, we found that higher SAT scores (verbal and quantitative scores combined) were associated with greater numeracy (r 5 .26)."
"845","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+101","However, after numeracy scores were regressed onto SATscores, the numeracy residuals showed a significant pattern of results similar to the pattern in Figure 2, specific contrast F(1, 30) 5 6.9, p < .05."
"846","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+102","We also obtained similar results when we controlled only for SAT quantitative scores (the results were somewhat weaker) and when we controlled for SAT verbal scores."
"847","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+103","We suspect that high-numeracy participants have relatively equal access to the percentage and frequency formats regardless of the format in which information is presented to them, whereas low-numeracy participants consider only the format they are given."
"848","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+104","Unpublished follow-up studies by Slovic showed that representations of risk in the form of probabilities (10% of 100 patients) led to relatively benign images of one person, whereas the ‘‘equivalent’’ frequentistic representations (10 out of 100 patients) created frightening images of violent patients (e.g., ‘‘Some guy going crazy and killing someone’’)."
"849","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+105","He suggested that these affect-laden images likely induced greater perceptions of risk in response to the frequency frame, compared with the probability frame (Slovic, Finucane, Peters, & MacGregor, 2004)."
"850","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+106","Although we did not test this idea directly in the present study, it is possible that less numerate participants are inﬂu- enced greatly by the affective imagery elicited by the fre- quentistic format and do not have access to this affective imagery when given the percentage format."
"851","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+107","At the same time, highly numerate participants may access the affect and affective imagery regardless of whether they receive information in the frequency or probability format, so that their risk perceptions do not vary by format."

"860","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+117","One of affect’s pri- mary functions is to provide meaning and motivation to choice processes (Damasio, 1994; Peters, in press)."

"864","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+121","We measured both affect (the valence of feelings) and affective precision (the clarity of those feelings)."
"865","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+122","Past studies have shown affective precision to pre- dict judgments independently of affect (Hsee, 1996; Mellers, Richards, & Birnbaum, 1992)."
"866","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+123","We used a paradigm developed by Denes-Raj and Epstein (1994), who showed that when offered a chance to win a prize by drawing a red jelly bean from a bowl, participants often elected to draw from a bowl containing a greater absolute number, but a smaller proportion, of red beans (e.g., 9 in 100 or 9%) rather than from a bowl with fewer red beans but a better probability of winning (e.g., 1 in 10 or 10%)."
"867","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+124","For these individuals, affective images of 9 winning beans in the large bowl appeared to dom- inate the image of 1 winning bean in the small bowl."
"868","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+125","When in- terviewed, many participants who had made nonoptimal choices reported a conﬂict between what they objectively knew were the better odds and how they felt about the bowl that offered a greater number of winners."
"869","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+126","A number of subjects indicated that the larger bowl ‘‘looked more inviting.’’"
"870","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+127","Affect can be a direct ‘‘hit’’ from an object (similar to Zajonc’s, 1980, notion that affect comes before conscious deliberation), or it can be the result of prior deliberation."
"871","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+128","We propose that in this task, affect as a direct hit from the number of winning beans conﬂicts with affect from thinking about the stated probability."
"872","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+129","We hypothesized that compared with the less numerate, the highly numerate would be more likely to deliberate about and compare probabilities and would draw from this deliberation a more precise affective reaction that would guide their decisions."
"873","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+130","Lacking a clear affective understanding of numbers, the less numerate would rely instead on readily available but less rele- vant affective sources, such as the number of winning beans."
"874","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+131","Thus, we predicted that less numerate adults, compared with highly numerate adults, would draw more often from the larger, affectively appealing bowl with less favorable objective proba- bilities."
"875","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+132","We also expected that affective reactions to the larger bowl, with its smaller probability of winning, would be more precise and more negative among the highly numerate than among the less numerate."

"879","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+136","Participants were asked from which bowl they would prefer to choose (on a scale that ranged from 6, strong preference for A, on the left, to 0 in the middle, to 6, strong preference for B, on the right); preferences for A were recorded as negative numbers prior to analysis."
"880","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+137","Participants were told to imagine that once they chose a bowl, it would be placed behind a screen, the beans would be mixed, and then they would draw a bean blindly from their chosen bowl."
"881","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+138","After indicating their preference, participants were asked a question about their affective precision (‘‘How clear a feeling do you have about the goodness or badness of Bowl A’s 9% chance of winning?’’), which they responded to on a scale ranging from 0, completely unclear, to 6, completely clear."
"882","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+139","Finally, they were asked about their affect (‘‘How good or bad does Bowl A’s 9% chance make you feel?’’), indicating their response on a 7-point scale ranging from —3, very bad, to 13, very good."

"886","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+144","However, the less numerate had less precise feelings about the 9% chance than the highly numerate did (affective precision 5 3.7 and 5.0, respectively), t(44) 5 —2.6, p < .01, d 5 0.78."

"888","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+146","In this study, we examined whether the highly numerate may sometimes make less ‘‘rational’’ responses than the less nu- merate precisely because they focus on the detail of numbers and draw more affective meaning from numerical comparisons."
"889","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+147","We used a paradigm (reported in Slovic et al., 2004) in which one group of subjects rates the attractiveness of a simple gamble (7 chances out of 36 to win $9; otherwise, win $0) on a scale from 0 through 20; a second group uses the same scale to rate a similar gamble with a small loss (7 chances out of 36 to win $9; 29 chances out of 36 to lose 5b)."
"890","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+148","With this paradigm, Slovic et al. obtained data that were anomalous from the perspective of economic theory."
"891","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+150","When the possible loss of 5b was added to the gamble, the mean attractiveness jumped to 14.9, and there was almost no overlap between the distributions of responses for the two groups."

"893","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+152","According to this view, a probability maps relatively precisely onto the attractiveness scale, because it has an upper and lower bound and people know where a given value falls within that range."
"894","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+153","The highly numerate, who are expected to deliberate more about numbers than the less numerate, should draw a more precise affective reaction from probability’s boundedness."
"895","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+154","In contrast, the mapping of a dollar outcome (e.g., $9) onto the scale is less precise, reﬂecting a failure to know whether $9 is good or bad, attractive or unat- tractive."
"896","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+155","Thus, the impression of the gamble offering a win of $9 and no losing payoff is dominated by the rather unattractive impression produced by the 7/36 probability of winning."
"897","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+156","How- ever, adding a very small loss to the payoff dimension puts the $9 payoff in perspective (i.e., it makes the payoff more affectively precise to the subject) and gives it meaning."
"898","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+157","The combination of a possible $9 gain and a possible 5b loss has a very attractive win/lose ratio, leading to a relatively precise mapping onto the upper part of the attractiveness scale."
"899","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+158","Whereas the imprecise mapping of the $9 when it is not combined with a loss carries little weight, the more precise and favorable impression of the $9 in the context of the small loss carries more weight, thus leading to an increase in the overall favorability of the gamble."
"900","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+159","We reasoned, however, that the ease of mapping results from the $9: —5b bet creating a perception of upper and lower bounds similar to probability’s boundedness and similar to comparing the 9% and 10% probabilities in Study 3."

"934","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+194","GENERAL DISCUSSION A series of four studies explored how the ability to understand and transform probability numbers relates to performance on judgment and decision tasks."
"935","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+195","Each task involved the processing of numbers; some tasks involved the processing of affect from the numbers themselves or from a competing source."
"936","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+196","Findings from Studies 1 and 2 were consistent with our hypothesis that com- pared with low-numeracy adults, high-numeracy adults are more likely to retrieve and use appropriate numerical principles and transform numbers presented in one frame to a different frame."
"937","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+197","We believe that low-numeracy decision makers are left with information that is less complete and less understood, lacking in the complexity and richness available to the more numerate."
"938","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+198","Results from Studies 3 and 4 were consistent with our hypothesis that the highly numerate tend to draw more affective meaning from probabilities and numerical comparisons than the less numerate do."
"939","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+199","Study 3 demonstrated that the less numerate were more inﬂuenced by an irrelevant affective source, perhaps because they drew less precise affective meaning from relevant numbers."
"940","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+200","In Study 4, the inﬂuence of numeracy on the attrac- tiveness of the bet was partially mediated by affect."
"941","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+201","The alter- native hypothesis that numeracy’s effect on decisions is due to general intelligence was not supported by these studies."
"942","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+202","The present research is an initial attempt to examine the roles of numeracy and affect in decision making."
"943","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+203","We examined the extent to which numerical ability serves as a mediator of deci- sion performance (helping performance in some situations and hurting performance in others)."
"944","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+204","Our measure of numeracy re- quires further development, but demonstrated fairly strong re- lations with decisions nonetheless."
"945","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+205","We also examined whether numeracy inﬂuences affect and affective precision and found that affect partially mediates the inﬂuence of numeracy in some decisions."
"946","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+206","This research adds to the growing body of knowledge concerning how affective and deliberative ways of thinking may inﬂuence important effects in decision making."
"947","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+207","It also demon- strates that individuals may differ in the type of assistance they need in making decisions."
"948","Numeracy and Decision Making_2006_A+208","Those low in numerical ability may need different decision aids than those high in numerical ability."

"1047","Numeracy moderates the influence of task-irrelevant affect on probability weighting_2016_A+93","Recent research on the role of numeracy and affect suggests that more numerate people are able to derive strong and precise affective meaning from probabilities or numbers in general  (Peters, 2012)."
"1048","Numeracy moderates the influence of task-irrelevant affect on probability weighting_2016_A+94","For instance, Peters et al.

"1125","Numeric, Verbal, and Visual Formats of Conveying Health Risks- Suggested Best Practices and Future Recommendations_2007_A+37","DEFINITION OF RISK Most recent conceptualizations of risk view risk as a combined function, often multiplicative, of the probability of loss and consequence of loss (e.g., severity of loss in the physical, psychological, social, and economic realms).8–12,a For example, the risk of taking a medication can be defined by the total number of possible side effects (i.e., conse- quences) and their associated probabilities."
"1126","Numeric, Verbal, and Visual Formats of Conveying Health Risks- Suggested Best Practices and Future Recommendations_2007_A+38","Despite the apparent simplicity of this definition, several issues arise concerning the operationalizing of risk.9 For example, should combining probability and severity be a multiplicative or some other function (e.g., additive)?"

"1130","Numeric, Verbal, and Visual Formats of Conveying Health Risks- Suggested Best Practices and Future Recommendations_2007_A+43","This will be aSome definitions of risk link probabilities with both positive and nega- tive outcomes rather than negative outcomes only."
"1131","Numeric, Verbal, and Visual Formats of Conveying Health Risks- Suggested Best Practices and Future Recommendations_2007_A+44","In this article, risk will be discussed in terms of negative outcomes, which is consistent with most definitions of the construct. consequences of lower severity be treated the same as an event with a lower probability of occurrence that has severe consequences (e.g., a cold versus a cancer)?"
"1132","Numeric, Verbal, and Visual Formats of Conveying Health Risks- Suggested Best Practices and Future Recommendations_2007_A+45","One point of contention in the operationali- zation of risk that is central to what formats of com- municating probabilistic information mean is the interpretation of probability."
"1133","Numeric, Verbal, and Visual Formats of Conveying Health Risks- Suggested Best Practices and Future Recommendations_2007_A+46","How probability is interpreted is controver- sial.13–15 Two classic orientations are whether prob- abilities refer to an objective likelihood of an event occurrence, as espoused by actuarial and epidemio- logical as well as frequentist approaches (e.g., what is the actual likelihood of experiencing dizziness by taking a medication based on what is observed in the population?), versus whether probabilities rep- resent beliefs about an event occurrence, as espou- sed, for example, by the Bayesian perspective (e.g., what do I believe is the likelihood of experiencing dizziness by taking a medication?)."
"1134","Numeric, Verbal, and Visual Formats of Conveying Health Risks- Suggested Best Practices and Future Recommendations_2007_A+47","Similar argu- ments pertain to consequences (e.g., what are the measurable losses versus the perceived severity of the losses?)."

"1137","Numeric, Verbal, and Visual Formats of Conveying Health Risks- Suggested Best Practices and Future Recommendations_2007_A+50","For example, are the data from the source intended to represent objective probabilities and/or beliefs?"
"1138","Numeric, Verbal, and Visual Formats of Conveying Health Risks- Suggested Best Practices and Future Recommendations_2007_A+51","Similarly, are people’s reactions to risk information expressions of objective facts, beliefs, or both?"
"1139","Numeric, Verbal, and Visual Formats of Conveying Health Risks- Suggested Best Practices and Future Recommendations_2007_A+52","Because probabilistic information can repre- sent both objective facts and opinions, it is good practice to clarify the intended meaning of the prob- ability."
"1140","Numeric, Verbal, and Visual Formats of Conveying Health Risks- Suggested Best Practices and Future Recommendations_2007_A+53","In this review, the focus is on the probability rather than the consequence (i.e., severity) dimen- sion."
"1141","Numeric, Verbal, and Visual Formats of Conveying Health Risks- Suggested Best Practices and Future Recommendations_2007_A+54","This is due to the greater abundance of studies that focus on communicating probabilistic rather than severity information."

"1143","Numeric, Verbal, and Visual Formats of Conveying Health Risks- Suggested Best Practices and Future Recommendations_2007_A+56","Below is a summary, not meant to be exhaustive, of outcomes used to evaluate the efficacy of risk communication processes."
"1144","Numeric, Verbal, and Visual Formats of Conveying Health Risks- Suggested Best Practices and Future Recommendations_2007_A+58","A risk communication is deemed effective if the resulting perceptions of risk lead to the recommended health- protective or disease-prevention behavior."
"1145","Numeric, Verbal, and Visual Formats of Conveying Health Risks- Suggested Best Practices and Future Recommendations_2007_A+59","A risk communication would be judged ineffective or even detrimental if it causes the person to act inappropri- ately (e.g., failing to get a mammogram because one judges one’s personal risk as low)."
"1146","Numeric, Verbal, and Visual Formats of Conveying Health Risks- Suggested Best Practices and Future Recommendations_2007_A+60","At times, there may not be consensus as to what actions a person should take (e.g., the benefits and risks are approxi- mately equal, or no consistent clear evidence of ben- efit exists)."
"1147","Numeric, Verbal, and Visual Formats of Conveying Health Risks- Suggested Best Practices and Future Recommendations_2007_A+61","In these situations, the focal outcomes may be whether the person truly understands the risks versus the benefits, makes a decision that is consistent with his or her values, is satisfied with the decision reached, and decreases possible feel- ings of regret should the decision lead to poor out- comes.19 For example, does a person who wishes not to suffer nausea as a result of cancer treatment choose a treatment that is consistent with these wishes?"
"1148","Numeric, Verbal, and Visual Formats of Conveying Health Risks- Suggested Best Practices and Future Recommendations_2007_A+63","A key factor in any communication is whether the target audience pays attention to the message."
"1149","Numeric, Verbal, and Visual Formats of Conveying Health Risks- Suggested Best Practices and Future Recommendations_2007_A+64","Risk messages that are attended to, as reflected in such outcomes as amount of information processed and reviewed, recall, use, and dissemination to others, can be considered effective in some situations."
"1150","Numeric, Verbal, and Visual Formats of Conveying Health Risks- Suggested Best Practices and Future Recommendations_2007_A+65","Thematically related, there is increasing attention to understanding the factors that influence a person’s motivation to pro- cess risk messages (e.g., confidence in his or her own knowledge, gender, time limitations) and the consequences of such processing.23–27 In general, it is argued that greater elaboration of risk messages increases the likelihood that the resulting percep- tions of risk will influence decisions and behaviors."
"1151","Numeric, Verbal, and Visual Formats of Conveying Health Risks- Suggested Best Practices and Future Recommendations_2007_A+67","Did the risk com- munication result in greater understanding of the phenomenon in question, especially in relation to the dimensions of understanding risk previously dis- cussed (e.g., knowledge of personal risk factors, understanding what actions to take to reduce or pre- vent the negative outcome, understanding the nature of the disease/event, understanding probabilities of an event occurring)?"
"1152","Numeric, Verbal, and Visual Formats of Conveying Health Risks- Suggested Best Practices and Future Recommendations_2007_A+69","Risk communications can cause undue positive or negative emotional reactions."
"1153","Numeric, Verbal, and Visual Formats of Conveying Health Risks- Suggested Best Practices and Future Recommendations_2007_A+70","For example, after receipt of risk information, do indivi- duals express undue anxiety, stress, or anger?"

"1156","Numeric, Verbal, and Visual Formats of Conveying Health Risks- Suggested Best Practices and Future Recommendations_2007_A+73","Indeed, newer models of risk and deci- sion making, such as risk as feelings28 and the affect heuristic,29 suggest that emotions play an important role in decision making."
"1157","Numeric, Verbal, and Visual Formats of Conveying Health Risks- Suggested Best Practices and Future Recommendations_2007_A+74","Studies may assess how the format of the risk communication affects emotional reactions, which in turn may have effects on deci- sions and behaviors."

"1168","Numeric, Verbal, and Visual Formats of Conveying Health Risks- Suggested Best Practices and Future Recommendations_2007_A+86","Numbers have several appealing qualities: they 1) are precise and as such lead to more accurate perceptions of risk than the use of probability phrases and graphical displays, 2) convey an aura of scientific credibility, 3) can be converted from one metric to another (e.g., 10%1 out of 10), 4) can be verified for accuracy (assuming enough observations), and 5) can be computed using algorithms, often based on epidemiological and/or clinical data, to provide a summary score (e.g., Gail score for breast cancer).31 Furthermore, it is assumed that many people appreciate numbers because of having received mathematical training in school and/or professionally and often use them in daily life (e.g., financial transactions)."
"1169","Numeric, Verbal, and Visual Formats of Conveying Health Risks- Suggested Best Practices and Future Recommendations_2007_A+88","Several numeric formats exist to express probabil- istic information, for example, percentages (0% to 100%), odds (e.g., 50 to 1), natural frequencies (e.g., 20 events observed out of 100), and classical prob- abilities (0 to 1)."
"1170","Numeric, Verbal, and Visual Formats of Conveying Health Risks- Suggested Best Practices and Future Recommendations_2007_A+89","These formats can be used to relay specific types of risk information, such as absolute risk, relative risk, attributable risk, and, more rec- ently, numbers needed to treat or harm.40 The num- ber needed to treat refers to the number of people who need to be treated for 1 person to benefit (e.g., 60 people need to be treated with a drug for 1 person to experience a benefit)."
"1171","Numeric, Verbal, and Visual Formats of Conveying Health Risks- Suggested Best Practices and Future Recommendations_2007_A+90","Numbers needed to harm is similar to the above, except it refers to how many people can undergo an intervention for 1 person to =be harmed."

"1451","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+4","In a computer task, participants were given four common-ratio effect and four common- consequence effect problems in each of four different formats."
"1452","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+5","In these problems, uncertainty information was described, as percentages (e.g., 80%) or as frequencies (e.g., 16/20), or was experienced, either serially (20 out- comes shown one at atime) or simultaneously (20 outcomes all shown at once)."
"1453","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+6","Presenting information as percentages attenuated the common-ratio effect and augmented the common-consequence effect, which suggests that these bi- ases have different underlying mechanisms."
"1454","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+7","Participants’ percentage estimates of outcome likelihoods did not differ according to the format in which the information was presented; however, participants’ nonverbal estimates of outcome likelihoods differed across formats."
"1455","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+8","The results suggest that uncertainty information presented as per- centages is processed differently than the same uncertainty information presented in other formats."

"1460","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+14","In all these choices, there is an element of uncertainty as to which particular outcome will occur, and how this uncertainty is represented and processed determines the choices organisms make."
"1461","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+15","In studies of decision making under uncertainty in humans, people receive information about the value of an outcome and its likelihood of occurrence before being asked to make a decision based on that information."

"1463","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+18","However, as Hertwig, Barron, Weber, and Erev (2004) pointed out, uncertainty infor- mation outside the laboratory must often be gathered from personal experience."
"1464","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+19","In addition, direct experience with envi- ronmental contingencies is the only way in which nonverbal animals can gather uncertainty information."
"1465","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+20","It is clear that both humans and nonverbal animals are able to extract this infor- mation from experience in order to behave adaptively."
"1466","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+21","It follows that a question of primary importance is how decision making varies as a function of how uncertainty information is presented."
"1467","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+22","Humans exhibit decision-making biases in which their choices are inconsistent with normative principles."
"1468","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+23","One might wonder whether such decision biases reﬂect the functioning of core cognitive mechanisms that are likely present across species or rather result from the use of the more recently developed and uniquely human capacity to represent probabilistic information in symbolic form."
"1469","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+24","This article focuses on how two decision- making biases, the common-ratio effect and the common-con- sequence effect, are inﬂuenced by the format in which uncer- tainty information is presented."
"1470","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+25","Consider the following choice: Low-risk, high-probability option: 100% chance of $3,000 High-risk, high-probability option: 80% chance of $4,000 People typically choose the low-risk option over the high-risk option, even though the expected value (probability multiplied by payout) of the low-risk option is lower."
"1471","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+26","Consider now a dif- ferent choice: Low-risk, low-probability option: 25% chance of $3,000 High-risk, low-probability option: 20% chance of $4,000 In such cases, people typically choose the high-risk option over the low-risk option (Allais, 1953; Kahneman & Tversky, 1979), even though these low-probability options are generated from the previous high-probability options by dividing the two prob- abilities by a constant value."
"1472","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+27","This preference reversal, termed the common-ratio effect, is nonnormative because it cannot be explained by a computation that uses unbiased estimates of outcome probabilities."
"1473","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+28","Rather, people act as if they are using a nonlinear probability-weighting function when determining the value of an option."
"1474","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+29","A similar preference reversal is seen in the common-conse- quence effect (Allais, 1953; B.J."
"1475","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+31","Consider the following choice: Low-risk, high-probability option: 100% chance of $2,400 High-risk, high-probability option: 66% chance of $2,400 and 33% chance of $2,500 Again, people typically choose the low-risk option over the high- risk option, even though the expected value of the low-risk op- tion is lower than the expected value of the high-risk option."

"1477","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+33","Notice, however, that this time a common payout (a 66% chance of $2,400) was subtracted out of the two high-probability options in order to obtain the low-probability options."
"1478","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+34","Like the common- ratio effect, this preference reversal is nonnormative because it cannot be explained by a computation that uses unbiased esti- mates of outcome probabilities."
"1479","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+35","In order to accommodate the common-ratio effect, the com- mon-consequence effect, and other phenomena, descriptive theories propose that people multiply the subjective value of a payout by a weighted function of objective probability in order to determine the value of an option (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979; Tversky & Kahneman, 1992)."
"1480","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+36","It is typical of the hypothesized weighting function that low probabilities are overweighted, middle and high probabilities are underweighted, and the function is steepest near probabilities of 0 and 1."

"1483","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+39","Recently, however, Barron and Erev (2003) and Hertwig et al. (2004) presented evidence showing that the common-ratio effect reverses when uncertainty information is not presented symbolically as probabilities, but rather must be extracted from experience."
"1484","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+40","Barron and Erev used a task in which, after each choice, participants received feedback about whether a small outcome had been won or not."
"1485","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+41","Hertwig et al. used a task in which participants sampled outcomes from two lotteries until they were ready to choose one of the lotteries from which to gain a randomly selected outcome."
"1486","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+42","It is noteworthy that these two studies used quite different procedures, one involving feedback and multiple decisions, the other involving a single decision without feedback, but obtained similar results (but see Battalio, Kagel, & MacDonald, 1985, and MacDonald, Kagel, & Battalio, 1991, for reports of a common-ratio effect in bar- pressing rats)."
"1487","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+43","Both Barron and Erev (2003) and Hertwig et al. (2004) ex- plained their results as due to the underrepresentation of rare events in small samples."
"1488","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+44","The number of low-probability events in a given sample size is described by the binomial distribution, which becomes increasingly skewed as sample size decreases."
"1489","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+45","This skew means that rare events are more likely to be under- represented than overrepresented, and to a larger degree as sample size decreases."
"1490","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+46","According to Barron and Erev (2003), when their participants accumulated information across time, they weighted recent events more strongly than earlier events."
"1491","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+47","This effectively de- creased the sample size from which to make likelihood esti- mates, leading to an underrepresentation of rare events."
"1492","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+48","In addition, participants in the study by Hertwig et al. (2004) were allowed to stop sampling from the different lotteries whenever they liked."
"1493","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+49","Because they sampled a relatively small number of times, rare events were measurably underrepresented."

"1499","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+55","This might lead subjects to prefer the risky option in the high-probability choice, thus attenuating or reversing the common-ratio effect."
"1500","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+56","In the current study, we built on the work of Hertwig et al. (2004) and aimed to extend previous ﬁndings in four ways."
"1501","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+57","First, we investigated decision making in common-ratio effect prob- lems in which uncertainty information was acquired through trial-by-trial experience but recency effects and sampling biases were minimized by constraining both sampling and the sequence of sampled outcomes."
"1502","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+58","Second, we extended the paradigm to the common-consequence effect, which is thought to result from the same mechanisms that lead to the common- ratio effect."
"1503","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+59","Third, we included three additional presentation formats for uncertainty information: In a second experience condition, all information was presented simultaneously, and in two descriptive conditions, information was presented either as frequencies or as percentages."
"1504","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+60","Finally, we investigated whether format-dependent differences in choice behavior reﬂect differ- ences in the underlying representations of uncertainty or in how those representations are used in a forced-choice setting (i.e., differences in the probability-weighting functions)."
"1505","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+61","We predicted that the decision-making biases would be most apparent when likelihoods were explicitly described as per- centages and least apparent when likelihoods had to be ex- tracted from trial-by-trial experience."
"1506","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+62","This prediction stemmed from the assumption that behavior will be more normative when information is presented in a format that is readily interpreted by core cognitive mechanisms than when it is presented in a format that can only be interpreted with the help of more recently evolved abstract reasoning mechanisms."
"1507","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+63","Indeed, Gigerenzer and Hoffrage (1995) reported a series of studies generally con- sistent with this idea: Inferences were more normative when probability information was presented as natural frequencies than when it was presented as probabilities or standardized frequencies."

"1562","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+137","To determine whether additional parameters were justiﬁable, we computed the odds in favor of particular functions using an equation pro- posed by Schwartz (1978): 1 oddsmodel1 ¼ exp½LLmodel1 — LLmodel2 — 2 ðd1 — d2Þ logðnÞ]; where LLi refers to the maximum log likelihood for model i, di refers to the number of free parameters in model i, and n refers to the number of total ob- servations in both models."

"1574","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+151","That study suggests that the systematic differences observed in the percentage condition of the current experiment might have resulted from a subset of our population that was below average in general ability to process basic probabilistic information."
"1575","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+152","Unfortunately, we did not col- lect numeracy data on our participants and cannot check this possibility."
"1576","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+153","One of our initial hypotheses was that there is an important distinction between uncertainty information extracted from experience and explicitly described uncertainty information."
"1577","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+154","However, our results suggest that not all forms of explicitly described uncertainty information should be grouped together (also see Gigerenzer & Hoffrage, 1995)."
"1578","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+155","Rather, the overall pattern of results suggests that frequency information is pro- cessed more similarly to information extracted from experience than to percentage information."
"1579","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+156","One important way in which percentages differ from frequencies and experienced informa- tion is that percentages, like probabilities, are unitless and contain no information about the number of times an individual event occurred."
"1580","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+157","We also predicted that the decision-making biases would be minimized when information was directly extracted from trial- by-trial experience."
"1581","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+158","This was the case for the common-conse- quence effect, but not for the common-ratio effect."
"1582","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+159","If anything, the common-ratio effect was augmented when information was extracted from experience."
"1583","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+160","This pattern is problematic for the view that the common-ratio effect and common-consequence effect are both certainty effects and share an underlying mechanism."
"1584","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+161","If these two biases derive from common mecha- nisms, that is, mechanisms that underweight high probabilities and overweight certainty, then factors that augment one of the biases should also augment the other."
"1585","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+162","For example, one might explain the ﬁnding of a common-consequence effect in the percentage condition by assuming that percentages are mapped to nonverbal representations of uncertainty before those esti- mates are used to decide between options."
"1586","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+163","Because the mapping of percentages to nonverbal estimates of uncertainty leads to the greatest underweighting of high probabilities, the common- consequence effect should be largest in the percentage condi- tion."
"1587","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+164","However, this line of reasoning would also predict the largest, not the smallest, common-ratio effect in the percentage condition."
"1588","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+165","The fact that the pattern of results for the common- ratio effect was essentially the opposite of the pattern of results for the common-consequence effect suggests that the two phe- nomena have different underlying mechanisms, despite the fact that they both appear to illustrate a certainty effect."
"1589","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+168","In summary, we found a common-ratio effect in humans when uncertainty information had to be extracted from experience."
"1590","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+169","However, uncertainty information extracted from experience did not lead to a common-consequence effect, even though the bias was observed when the same information was expressed as percentages."
"1591","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+170","This interaction of presentation format and type of bias suggests that the common-consequence effect and the common-ratio effect do not share the same underlying mecha- nism."
"1592","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+171","The across-format differences in choice behavior were not the result of the transformation of nonverbal representations of uncertainty into symbolic representations, as percentage esti- mates of uncertainty did not vary across formats."
"1593","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+172","However, nonverbal estimates of uncertainty did vary as a function of format of presentation."
"1594","The Format in Which Uncertainty Information Is Presented Affects Decision Biases_2007_A+173","Most notable was a nonlinearity in the transformation of percentages into nonverbal magnitudes that was reminiscent of the hypothesized probability-weighting function."

"1794","The polarizing impact of science literacy and numeracy on perceived climate change risks_2012_A+18","SCT asserts, first, that ordinary members of the public underestimate the seriousness of climate change because of the difficulty of the scientific evidence3."

"1939","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+38","×Several previous studies, which we discuss in greater detail below, examine how the formats of prices and returns affect subjective expectations."
"1940","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+39","However, they present mixed results, which may be due to differences in study design."
"1941","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+40","For instance, Diacon and Hasseldine (2007) and Sto¨ssel and Meier (2015) focus on the effect of the chart format and a mixture of chart formats by holding the question format constant, while Glaser et al. (2007) examine the effect of the question format by holding the chart format constant."
"1942","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+42","First, we resolve the apparent contradictions offered by previous studies by separating the effect of the chart format (i.e., return bar chart vs. price line chart) from the effect of the question format     (i.e., expected price vs. expected return)."
"1943","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+43","For this purpose, in two laboratory studies we vary the format of the chart and the format of the question in a 2 2 between-subject design."
"1944","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+44","Second, we test the boundaries of subjects’ susceptibil- ity to format changes by testing it under different conditions: different levels    of expertise and experience (i.e., students in the lab vs. finance professionals), different amounts of information (i.e., historical charts only vs. real-world × information), and different incentive schemes (i.e., fixed vs. performance- based)."

"1947","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+48","We show that the sizeable effects of the chart and question formats are not mitigated by performance- based incentives, expertise, or real-world information."
"1948","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+49","In addition, we show that neither dividend yield, nor risk premium or the use of simple heuristics can explain our findings."
"1949","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+50","We find, however, that the chart and question formats have a larger effect if subjects score low on cognitive reflection, which indicates that they tend to rely on their intuition rather than reflecting upon their answers."

"1951","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+52","Furthermore, the formats of prices and returns also draw attention to different episodes of the past."

"1955","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+56","Information platforms and finan- cial advisors could thus either willingly or unwillingly manipulate investors’ expectations by varying the format through  which  their  investors  perceive the past and think about the future."

"2006","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+113","It is possible that regulation might induce a change in format use even  beyond the narrow scope of its target."
"2007","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+114","For instance, in 2011 the European Commission began to require return charts as part of the successor of the simplified prospectus—the Key Investor Information Document (KIID).2 Although the regulation does not apply to fund factsheets,  the  majority  of  fund companies currently use return charts."
"2008","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+116","Figure 1 shows that the use of return charts has increased by 30 percentage points between 2008 and  2017,  mainly  due  to  a  jump  around  the introduction of the regulation in 2011."
"2009","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+117","Although  we  cannot  be  certain  that the jump was caused by the regulation, the evidence suggests that fund companies’ preferences to use one chart format over another are far from rigid."

"2086","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+205","Specifically, in Study 2 we introduce the following four modifications."
"2087","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+207","In Study 1, participants receive a fixed remuneration of 4 euros, whereas in Study 2 the remuneration depends on the subject’s forecast accuracy."
"2088","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+208","Upon completion of the main task, we randomly draw one asset, which determines the subject’s remuneration."
"2089","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+209","Subjects are told that they will earn 21 euros if one of their randomly drawn forecasts is “reasonably close” to the true realization and 6 euros otherwise."
"2090","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+210","We use a verbal description of the accuracy interval instead of a numerical description to avoid differences in the format of the numerical intervals contaminating the results."
"2091","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+211","All subjects whose absolute error is below the absolute error of 80% of the subjects in the respective session earned 21 euros; the remaining subjects earned 6 euros."
"2092","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+212","The average remuneration in each  group is shown in Figure 2."
"2093","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+213","We  note that the average remuneration in Study      2 is higher than in Study 1 because the main part of Study 2 is longer—the   main part of Study 1 took on average 6.1 minutes to complete, while the main part of Study 2 took on average 17.4 minutes to complete."
"2094","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+214","Second, to isolate   the impact of potential errors in the reporting of negative numbers, we extend the forecasting task by adding a categorical  question."
"2095","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+215","In  particular,  subjects are asked to assess on a three-point  Likert-type  scale  whether  they  expect the return to be roughly positive/zero/negative (for the task return treatment) or roughly higher/equal/lower than the current price level (for the task price treatment)."
"2096","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+216","This question was elicited before the respective numerical forecast."
"2097","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+217","Third, to test for a potential anchoring effect, we vary the  charts’  starting  price."
"2098","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+218","In Study 1, all price line charts in the stimulus price treatment are generated based on a starting price of 100 monetary units."
"2099","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+219","In Study 2,  the charts for half of the subjects start from a price level of 100 monetary units, while the charts for the other half of the subjects start from a price level of 1,000 monetary units."
"2100","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+220","This variation is included as a between-subject factor     to ensure that the scale of the y-axis is constant for each subject."
"2101","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+221","To ensure sufficient power to test for anchoring effects, we double the number of charts per subject from 10 in Study 1 to 20 in Study 2."
"2102","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+222","Finally, to analyze potential misperceptions of the average past return from price charts in Study 2, we include a control task subsequent in the main part  of the study."
"2103","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+223","In particular,  we ask subjects, who are shown price line charts, to report their assessment     of the average monthly return."
"2104","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+224","We conduct the control task over a random selection of 10 charts out of the 20 that were previously shown to the subject."
"2105","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+225","Between-Subject Treatments In the two different stimuli, the charts display either the simulated price level development, as illustrated in Figure 3, or the simulated return devel- opment, as illustrated in Figure 4."
"2106","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+226","In both cases, the scale of the y-axis is  held constant for each subject."
"2107","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+227","The selection of the highest and lowest levels displayed on the y-axis ensures that the range covers all observations across all charts displayed to the subject."
"2108","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+228","Furthermore, we require the range to be wide enough that at least the 90% confidence interval of the true return distribution is conceivable at the time of forecasting."
"2109","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+229","The last price level is explicitly printed in the upper-right corner of the charts to reduce the noise associated with estimating it."
"2110","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+230","In Study 2, we further reduce the salience of the return bar charts by widening the y-scale of the charts in the stimulus return treatment."
"2111","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+231","The two distinct tasks require subjects to report their expectation regarding the future price level, which we use to calculate the implicit return expectation, or to report their expectation of the future return."

"2113","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+237","(Color figure can be viewed at wileyon- linelibrary.com) (2007), we ask subjects in the task price treatment to report the median future price level and subjects in the task return treatment to report the median future return."
"2114","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+238","The exact wording of the two treatments is as follows: Task Price: “Please provide a forecast of the future price level (in monetary units) of this financial market instrument one month from now."
"2115","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+239","The actual realization of the future price level should lie with equal probability above or below your forecast.”"

"2118","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+242","The median is the estimator that minimizes the mean absolute deviation."
"2119","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+243","To ensure consistency between the wording of the question and the incentives scheme, subjects in Study 2 are incentivized based on the absolute deviation of their response from the realization."
"2120","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+244","To ensure that subjects understand the term “return,” we include a definition in the instructions, which states that a return is the percentage change in the price."
"2121","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+246","In line with previous experimental studies on judgmental forecasting (e.g., Beshears et al. (2013)), subjects could not use calculators."
"2122","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+247","In Studies 1 and 2, we focus on understanding expectation formation based on charts of the past performance, as previous literature shows that charts are a prominent source of information for investors (e.g., Greenwood and Shleifer (2014))."
"2123","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+248","In the real world, however, investors also have other information sources and tools at their disposal."
"2124","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+249","Therefore, in Study 3 we extend the focus of the laboratory studies from judgmental forecasting to forecasting based on real-world information from diverse sources."
"2125","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+250","Study 3: Expert Forecasts with Real-World Information Study 3 differs from Studies 1 and 2 mainly in the subjects’ high level of expertise and experience and the larger amount of information available to them."
"2126","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+251","The professionals in Study 3 forecast on an everyday basis making use    of the information sources that are typically available to them."
"2127","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+252","Thus, in Study     3 we vary only the question format (i.e., task)."
"2128","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+254","This study consists of  12 waves between September 2012 and June 2015."

"2130","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+256","Over the course of the study, the average monthly DAX return was 1.5% with a standard deviation of 4.5%."
"2131","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+257","Thus, the sample distribution of the monthly DAX return was close to the positive-mean distribution in Studies 1 and 2."
"2132","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+258","Prior to Study 3, subjects are randomly assigned to one of two between- subject treatments: a task return treatment, in which subjects are asked to fore- cast the DAX return, and a task price treatment, in which subjects are asked to forecast the DAX level."
"2133","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+259","The assignment of the treatments remains unchanged over the course of the study."
"2134","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+262","Task Return: “Within 1 month I expect a DAX return (monthly percentage change) of ... percent.”"
"2135","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+263","The wording for the task price treatment is adopted from the ZEW Financial Market Survey."

"2141","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+273","In contrast to laboratory studies, online studies have the potential disad- vantage that subjects can withhold their response or drop out (i.e., attrition)."
"2142","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+274","Attrition may interfere with the internal  validity of the results to the extent  that subjects decide whether to participate based on the treatment they are randomly assigned to."
"2143","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+275","To rule out concerns regarding potential treatment- dependent attrition in Study 3, we compare the two treatments based on participation rates, observable demographics, and responses to other stock market questions."
"2144","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+277","In sum- mary, we show that the participation rates in both treatments are close to 100% among professionals who have responded at least once to a survey question that is comparable to the experimental task."
"2145","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+278","Furthermore, we do not find any indication of treatment-dependent attrition based on comparison of observable demographics or responses to other stock market questions."
"2146","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+279","Although we find no indication of treatment-dependent attrition, there is evidence of favorable treatment-independent selection."
"2147","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+280","Specifically, we find that Study 3 contains a higher proportion of professional forecasters than the rest of the ZEW sample."
"2148","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+281","Data Preparation To ensure that the subjects comprehend the forecasting task, we perform consistency checks."
"2149","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+282","Outliers in the experimental studies can arise if subjects mistakenly respond to the format of the chart instead of to the actual question asked."
"2150","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+283","For instance, a subject who is asked to forecast returns and submits responses around 100, that is, in the range of the last price level, is likely to have only skim-read the instructions."
"2151","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+285","For subjects who initially respond using the wrong format and subsequently switch to the correct format, only the responses given in the wrong format are excluded."
"2152","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+286","Overall, we exclude 3.6% of the observations in Study 1 and 2.5% of the obser- vations in Study 2."
"2153","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+287","In Study 3, we ensure that the return expectations are not unequivocally inconsistent with subjects’ responses to other questions."
"2154","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+288","To do so, we use subjects’ responses to an additional question about the 90% confidence interval associated with their one-month-ahead DAX forecasts."
"2155","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+289","The subjective confidence intervals on the one-month-ahead DAX forecasts were elicited in the format of the main forecasting question."
"2156","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+290","As a consistency check, we require that the subject’s DAX forecast lies within the respective subjective 90% confidence interval."
"2157","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+291","This criterion results in the exclusion of 17 observations submitted    by 11 professionals, which make up 1.2% of the observations in Study 3."

"2213","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+353","We  further  argue that the task effect is rather likely to occur in their everyday forecasts outside the scope of Study 3 for the following reason."
"2214","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+355","For this purpose, we elicit supplementary information on the professionals’ usual forecast format and use this information to categorize the professionals based on the proximity of the task format in Study 3 to their usual forecast format."
"2215","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+356","We  find that the  task effect holds in both their monthly and their annual forecasts."
"2216","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+357","Our finding of a positive effect of the task return treatment and a negative effect of the stimulus return treatment contradict results from previous experimental studies."
"2217","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+358","Diacon and Hasseldine (2007) do not find the chart format  to  have  a  significant  effect  on  subjective  return  expectations."
"2218","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+359","Sto¨ssel and Meier (2015) document significantly stronger optimism when subjects are shown return bar charts while simultaneously being asked to forecast returns."
"2219","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+360","Glaser et al. (2007) suggest that the task effect depends on the historical trend, in particular,  subjects in the task return treatment report higher expectations   if the chart that is displayed covers a period of positive performance but lower expectations if the chart covers a period of negative performance."
"2220","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+361","The authors explain their result with the representativeness heuristic, according to which subjective expectations in the task price treatment derive from the  average past price, whereas expectations in the task  return  treatment  are  based  on the average past return."
"2221","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+362","In a robustness check, we analyze whether the main treatment effects depend on the sign of the sample average return."
"2222","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+364","The difference between our results and previous studies could be due to two main variations in study design."
"2223","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+365","First, to vary past performance, Glaser et al. (2007) use charts of different stocks and show subjects the names of these stocks."
"2224","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+366","Differences in the subjects’ familiarity with the respective up-trending and down-trending stocks may have influenced the results."
"2225","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+367","Second, the above studies draw only a few data sequences, which are the same for all subjects, whereas we use different data  sequences  for every subject in a given treatment to ensure that our results hold for a variety  of possible patterns."
"2226","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+368","In addition, various prior design choices allow potential confounding factors to influence  the  results,  which  may  help  explain  why  we obtain different results using a cleaner design."
"2227","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+369","For instance, Diacon and Hasseldine (2007) show subjects high-frequency price charts but low-frequency return charts and Glaser et al. (2007) set the scale and position of the y-axis endogenously based on the first and last prices of the data sequence."
"2228","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+370","One can alternatively hypothesize that the task and the stimulus may distort the subjective risk perception, which may affect expectations through a required risk premium rather than directly."
"2229","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+371","To  test whether  distortions  of the subjective risk perception mediate the task effect, we measure the subjective risk  perception  of  the  professionals  in  Study  3."
"2230","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+372","In  addition, we conduct a supplementary in-class experimental study with 213 undergrad- uate students from the Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich to test for the risk perception as an explanation of both the stimulus effect and the task effect."
"2231","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+373","The in-class study closely follows the design of our baseline Study 1, as described in the Internet Appendix."
"2232","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+374","To ensure the robustness of our results, we use two alternative measures of subjective risk perception."
"2233","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+375","In Study 3 and in the supplementary in-class study, we use a numerical measure of the subjective 90% confidence intervals."
"2234","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+376","Because of limitations of the subjective confidence intervals as a measure of risk perception (e.g., Langnickel and Zeisberger (2016)), in the supplementary study we also elicit a universal qualitative measure."
"2235","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+377","In particular, we ask subjects to rank each financial asset using a scale from risk-free to very risky."
"2236","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+378","We show that both the task effect and the stimulus effect are robust to controlling for both measures of subjective  risk perception."
"2237","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+380","Regarding the stimulus effect, it can be further hypothesized that the difference in expectations is driven by the difference between a geometric average and an arithmetic average of past returns."
"2238","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+381","In particular, one can argue that return bar charts enable quick estimation of the arithmetic average, whereas price line charts facilitate estimation of the geometric average."
"2239","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+382","However, the difference between the geometric average and the arithmetic average of past returns cannot explain our results because it predicts an opposite sign on the stimulus effect."
"2240","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+383","Since the stimulus return supposedly induces arithmetic averaging and the arithmetic average is greater than or equal to the geometric average, the stimulus return should be connected to higher expectations, which does not hold in our results."
"2241","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+384","Still, the different formats might induce different averaging but its small effect might be offset by other factors."
"2242","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+385","Given the data-generating process in Studies 1 and 2, the predicted positive stimulus effect is 0.16 percentage points per month."
"2243","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+386","In Studies 1 and 2, we focus explicitly on forecasting based on charts (i.e., judgmental forecasting).8 Examining judgmental forecasting is important because investors rely heavily on charts of past performance in the real world, despite other information sources being available."
"2244","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+387","This has been shown  for both retail and institutional investors (see, e.g., Amromin and Sharpe (2014), Greenwood and Shleifer (2014))."
"2245","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+388","The consistency of our results from Studies     1 and 2 compared to Study 3, where subjects have real-world information at their disposal, supports this view."
"2246","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+389","In summary, we show that the chart and the question format can induce heterogeneity with respect to subjective expectations in financial markets  in a predictable way."
"2247","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+390","Specifically, our results imply that arbitrary format differences and format changes that occur in the real world have a predictable but unintended impact on investors’ expectations."
"2248","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+391","For instance, recall that an investor who searches for information on the past performance of an index fund (e.g., MSCI World ETF) is more likely to find return charts than an investor who looks up the index directly (e.g., MSCI World index)."
"2249","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+392","Against this backdrop, our results imply that the former investor would be systematically more pessimistic than the latter investor."
"2250","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+393","Analogously, our results imply that the introduction of return charts in the KIIDs of European funds might have resulted in greater pessimism among their investors, all other things equal."
"2251","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+394","Our evidence further suggests that having practical experience in financial markets is not a useful remedy since professionals with decades of experience in the finance industry are not immune to the effect of the question format."
"2252","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+395","In Section IV, we examine possible explanation for why this is the case."
"2253","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+396","8 Given that only past performance information is provided to the subjects, the optimal strategy to forecast the median future return without any prior information would be to report the sample median return over the period covered by the chart."
"2254","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+397","Why Prices and Returns Affect Expectations In this section, we examine why prices and returns affect expectations."
"2255","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+398","First, we narrow the search for potential explanations by showing that subjects who reflect and deliberate instead of relying on their intuition have both a smaller stimulus effect and a smaller task effect."
"2256","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+399","Second, we explore specific characteristics of the way intuition processes numbers and performs mental calculations that might help explain the two effects."
"2257","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+400","The Role of Intuition In the psychological literature, the effect of irrelevant aspects of the decision situation is typically ascribed to the influence of impulsive, intuitive thinking (Kahneman and Frederick (2007))."
"2258","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+401","According to dual processing theory, there are at least two processes of thought."
"2259","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+403","This process happens subconsciously, requires prior knowledge and experience with the task, and is slow to change if systematic mistakes occur."
"2260","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+404","On the other hand, there is slower, deliberate, reflective, and effortful reasoning, labeled System 2."
"2261","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+405","The tendency to think intuitively or deliberately can be thought of as a cognitive style or a mental state."
"2262","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+406","For the purposes of the laboratory experiments, we use the three-item CRT of Frederick (2005) and the additional four items recently proposed by Toplak, West, and Stanovich (2014)."
"2263","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+407","The CRT constitutes an inventory of questions for which an intuitive but wrong answer quickly comes to mind."
"2264","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+408","The measure was originally proposed to capture a cognitive style denoted cognitive reflection—a subject’s tendency to question the initial intuitive answer and deliberately seek the correct solution."
"2265","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+409","However, recent evidence suggests that the CRT depends on characteristics of the decision environment and thus constitutes at least in part a mental state (Alter et al."
"2266","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+411","Previous studies relate high cognitive reflection to immunity against the valence framing effect (Frederick (2005)) and consistency in judgments and decisions (Cokely and Kelley (2009))."
"2267","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+412","We choose the CRT as it is not malleable by social desirability, that is, subjects’ willingness to look good in the test.9 9 The CRT has the disadvantage that the measure is not valid for subjects who have already heard the questions and consequently remember that the obvious solution is not correct."
"2268","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+413","This is likely to be the case among finance professionals, such as the subjects in Study 3, as the questions are often used in job interviews in the finance industry (e.g.,Crack (2015))."
"2269","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+414","Moreover, Study 3 is conducted online, giving the subjects the opportunity to look up the questions and discuss them with others, which makes the results incomparable to the results of laboratory studies."
"2270","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+415","Nevertheless,   we elicited the CRT scores of 98 professionals from Study 3 in September 2017."
"2271","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+416","Even though we used the less well-known extension of the CRT inventory proposed by Toplak, West, and Stanovich (2014), the majority of these professionals had a perfect score and the variation in the sample was very low."
"2272","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+417","Additionally, professionals took considerably longer to solve the task, which indicates that they might have taken advantage of the opportunity to look up the questions or discuss them with others."
"2273","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+418","Therefore, in Study 3 we additionally elicited self-reported measures of the importance of one’s intuition and analytical forecasting methods."

"2276","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+421","The main independent variables are a dummy variable for the task return treatment (Dtask=return), a dummy variable for the stimulus return treatment (Dstimulus=return), a measure for analytical     as opposed to intuitive thinking style, and the interaction between the latter and the treatment dummies."
"2277","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+422","As a measure of intuitive thinking style, we use the cognitive reflection test score consisting of four items (i.e., CRT4) and seven items (i.e., CRT7), centered around its median."
"2278","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+423","We control for the following demographic characteristics: age, gender, experience and interest in stock markets and financial markets in general, attendance of a statistics course and a behavioral finance course, and numeracy."

"2281","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+428","The main independent variables are treatment dummies, a measure of intuitive thinking centered around its median, and its interactions with the treatment dummies."
"2282","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+430","This constitutes a reduction of 26 % (56 %) compared to the scope of the task effect for a subject with a median CRT score."
"2283","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+433","10 Since the CRT consists of innately mathematical tasks, it can be argued that the dampening effect of a high CRT score on the main treatment effects may     be due to better mathematical skills rather than a stronger tendency to rely on analytical thinking."
"2284","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+434","Frederick (2005) reports a positive correlation between the CRT score and mathematical skills."
"2285","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+435","To distinguish between analytical thinking and mathematical skills, in a robustness check we additionally control for the impact of mathematical skills on the scope of the task effect and the stimulus effect."
"2286","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+436","For this purpose, in Studies 1 and 2 we elicit a measure of advanced nu- meracy as given by the Berlin Numeracy Test described by Cokely et al."
"2287","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+438","We extend the empirical analysis of Table IV to additionally test for an inter- action effect between advanced numeracy and the two  treatment  dummies."
"2288","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+439","Our results show that advanced numeracy does not have significant effect (at the 10% level) as a mediator of the two main effects."
"2289","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+440","Moreover, our results on the dampening effect of the CRT score on the task and stimulus effects are qualitatively unchanged when controlling for the effect of advanced numeracy."
"2290","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+441","It should be noted that  the  CRT  cannot  be  viewed  purely  as  a  cognitive style, and hence our results do not imply that investors with a high CRT score are immune to framing effects altogether."

"2292","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+444","Hence, every investor might poten- tially become susceptible to task and stimulus effects in some circumstances even though for some investors this is more likely than for others."
"2293","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+445","Intuition and Numbers From the results outlined in Section III, it  is  apparent  that  the  task  effect and the stimulus effect are driven by the treatments in which the  chart is displayed in a different format from the  format  of  the  question (i.e., mixed-format treatments)."
"2294","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+446","Mixed-format treatments are relevant as investors often have limited influence on chart formats."
"2295","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+447","For instance, a retail investor, who estimates the future value of an investment in a European fund based on the return bar charts displayed in the mandatory KIID, would find himself in a mixed-format forecasting task."
"2296","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+448","A distinctive characteristic of the mixed-format treatments is that they may prompt further mental calculations."
"2297","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+449","Systematic mistakes in these calculations could explain our results."
"2298","Thinking about Prices versus Thinking about Returns in Financial Markets_2019_A+450","In the previous subsection, we show that the task effect and the stimulus effect   are mediated by reliance on intuition, and thus various characteristics of one’s innate intuitive number sense, as described by Dehaene (2011), are particularly relevant for our setting."

"2514","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+5","In the study reported here, we addressed this issue by examining the role of linguistic mechanisms in forging the hierarchical structures of algebra."
"2515","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+6","In a 3-T functional MRI experiment, we showed that processing of the syntax-like operations of algebra does not rely on the neural mechanisms of natural language."
"2516","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+7","Our findings indicate that processing the syntax of language elicits the known substrate of linguistic competence, whereas algebraic operations recruit bilateral parietal brain regions previously implicated in the representation of magnitude."
"2517","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+8","This double dissociation argues against the view that language provides the structure of thought across all cognitive domains."
"2518","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+9","Keywords cognitive neuroscience, thinking, language, neuroimaging Received 7/24/11; Revision accepted 12/19/11 An influential view of human cognition situates core compo- nents of natural language at the center of diverse domains of thought (Levinson, 2003; Whorf, 1940)."
"2519","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+10","Arithmetic reasoning is often seen in this light because it is plausible that the struc- tured hierarchy found in algebraic expressions, such as 2 ×    (5 − 3), is mentally constructed from syntactic routines under- lying the interpretation of sentences, such as “The man saw the boy who kicked the ball.”"
"2520","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+11","In both cases, rules for evaluating subparts of the structure must be applied recursively in order to arrive at the semantic value of the whole."
"2521","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+12","Hauser, Chomsky, and Fitch (2002) state that both language and number rely on a recursive computation that exploits the same neural mecha- nism operating over linguistic structures."
"2522","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+13","Recursion, they sug- gest, evolved over time from a process that was highly domain specific to a process that was domain general, and this change gave humans the possibly unique ability to use recursion to solve nonlinguistic problems, notably, numerical manipula- tion."
"2523","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+14","Likewise, Spelke and Tsivkin (2001) stated that natural language was the “most striking combinatorial system” of the human mind and that formal mathematics might be one of this system’s “richest and most dramatic outcomes” (p."
"2524","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+16","The idea that nonlinguistic domains of thought, such as number, may co-opt the recursive machinery of language is made explicit by Chomsky (1998)."
"2525","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+17","He argued that the human faculty for arithmetical reasoning can be thought of as being abstracted from language and that it operates by “preserving the mechanisms of discrete infinity and eliminating the other special features of language” (p."
"2526","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+19","Similarly, Fitch, Hauser, and Chomsky (2005) state that the only clear demonstrations that recursion operates in human cognitive domains come from mathematical formulas and computer programming, which clearly employ the same reasoning processes that lan- guage does."
"2527","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+20","This view has been sharpened by the proposal that the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) acts “supramodally” to forge complex hierarchical dependencies for nonlinguistic domains (Fadiga, Craighero, & D’Ausilio, 2009; Tettamanti & Weniger, 2006)."
"2528","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+21","The former authors propose that IFG and ven- tral premotor cortex “are tuned to detect and represent com- plex hierarchical dependencies, regardless of modality and use” (p."
"2529","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+23","The authors discuss this idea in the context of language, action, and music, because these three domains “share a common syntax-like structure” (p."
"2530","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+25","As discussed, however, this same syntax-like structure is also present in algebraic expressions, a characteristic that has been proposed to derive directly from the properties of natural language."

"2532","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+28","It is worth noting that the latter hypothesis is neutral regard- ing the specific processes that are implemented in left IFG."
"2533","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+29","Such processes might correspond to syntactic movement (Grodzinsky & Santi, 2008), registration of long-range depen- dencies (Friederici, Bahlmann, Heim, Schubotz, & Anwander, 2006), unification of lexical  information  (Hagoort,  2005), or selection among competing representations (Novick, Trueswell, & Thompson-Schill, 2010)."
"2534","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+30","In the study reported here, we evaluated the role of lan- guage in arithmetic cognition by comparing the manipulation of linguistic versus algebraic expressions."

"2538","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+34","However, the two equivalence judgments rest on vocabulary from distinct cognitive domains."
"2539","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+35","In Argu- ment A, the judgment depends on whether the principal verb assigns the same semantic roles (i.e., who did what to whom) to X, Y, and Z across a syntactic transformation."
"2540","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+36","In Argument B, the judgment depends on the properties of elementary alge- braic operations (i.e., addition, subtraction) and relations (i.e., equality, inequality)."
"2541","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+37","Arguments C and D illustrate nonequiva- lent pairs of linguistic and algebraic statements, respectively."
"2542","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+38","It is uncontroversial that language mechanisms are required to encode the two statements of an argument."
"2543","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+39","We tested the more substantive claim that language accompanies reasoning beyond the point of encoding in both the linguistic and algebraic domains."
"2544","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+40","We obtained blood-oxygenation-level- dependent recordings from 21 right-handed volunteers with no known history of neurological disorders while they evaluated whether linguistic and algebraic arguments were logically equivalent (an equivalence task) and grammatically well formed (a grammar, or baseline, task)."

"2620","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+132","Functional brain activity In relation to grammar trials with linguistic stimuli, equivalence trials with linguistic stimuli elicited greater activation in left- hemisphere regions previously reported for linguistic process- ing (Fig. 2a; Monti et al., 2009; Pallier et al., 2011)."
"2621","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+133","In particular, this contrast revealed significant activation in both the pars opercularis and pars triangularis of left IFG (Brodmann’s area, BA, 44 and 45, respectively), as well as in posterior segments of MTG (BA 21) and STG (BA 22)."

"2624","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+136","Instead, exten- sive activation was observed in regions previously reported a b for number cognition and calculation (Dehaene et al., 2003; Zago et al., 2001), including bilateral hIPS and SPL, left IPL (BA 40), middle frontal gyrus (BA 6), and the medial seg- ments of precuneus (BA 7)."

"2638","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+153","For all of these regions, the interaction was driven by a significant simple effect of task for the linguistic stimuli only (this interaction was only marginally significant in STG)."

"2643","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+158","Discussion Our findings indicate that beyond initial reading and compre- hension of stimuli, the neural substrate of language does not intervene in algebraic reasoning."
"2644","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+159","In fact, as Figure 3 shows, many of the perisylvian linguistic regions appeared to be less active during the algebraic equivalence task than during sim- ple reading (i.e., the grammar task), a finding that parallels previous reports in the domain of mental calculation (Fodor- enko, Behr, & Kanwisher, 2011; Zago et al., 2001)."
"2645","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+160","Interpreta- tion of this finding will require further research."
"2646","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+161","In contrast, perisylvian regions were observed to be active for the linguis- tic equivalence task, as expected."
"2647","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+162","The observed dissociation is consistent with the findings of investigations of linguistic and arithmetic abilities in neuro- logical patients (Cappelletti, Butterworth, & Kopelman, 2001; Cipolotti, Butterworth, & Denes, 1991) and individuals with developmental disorders (Butterworth, 2005; Mazzocco et al., 2006)."
"2648","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+163","Particularly relevant is the case of patients with agram- matic aphasia, who exhibit intact understanding of the rules, structure, and operations of abstract algebra but perform at chance levels in standard assessments of language (Varley, Klessinger, Romanowski, & Siegal, 2005)."
"2649","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+164","Our results suggest that the latter finding is not due to compensatory strategies or functional remapping following brain injury."
"2650","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+165","Our linguistic and algebraic problems yielded common activations in left posterior and medial regions of parietal cor- tex."
"2651","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+166","In the domain of number cognition, posterior SPL has been proposed to support mental arithmetic (Knops, Thirion, Hubbard, Michel, & Dehaene, 2009) by mediating attentional orientation along the spatial representation of the number line (Dehaene et al., 2003)."
"2652","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+167","However, such spatial processing in SPL does not seem to be specific to number cognition because it occurs across a variety of tasks requiring manipulation and rearrangement of information in working memory (Koenigs, Barbey, Postle, & Grafman, 2009) and allocation of attention (see Dehaene et al., 2003)."
"2653","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+168","In addition, the engagement we found here in left SPL is consistent with its recruitment across verbal (Osaka, Kemori, Morishita, & Osaka, 2007), numeric, and spatial working memory tasks (Hanakawa et al., 2002), as well as for linguistic and logic inference (Monti et al., 2009)."
"2654","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+169","Finally, the common recruitment of precuneal cortex across linguistic and algebraic materials may reflect the generally greater complexity of the equivalence tasks, as compared with the grammar tasks, across both domains (cf."
"2655","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+171","Algebraic problems strongly and specifically recruited bilat- eral portions of hIPS."
"2656","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+172","These regions are typically activated in the context of numerical comparisons, approximation, and esti- mation (Nieder & Dehaene, 2009; Piazza, Pinel, Le Bihan, & Dehaene, 2007)."
"2657","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+173","Our stimuli, in contrast, contained neither numerals nor specific magnitudes, yet the foci uncovered by the equivalence task for algebra closely matched the hIPS subre- gions defined by a large meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies on number cognition (Dehaene et al., 2003)."
"2658","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+174","A potential inter- pretation is that hIPS embodies a domain-general ordering abil- ity extending not just to numbers but also to algebraic variables (as we found here), letters of the alphabet (Fias, Lammertyn, Caessens, & Orban, 2007), months of the year (Ischebeck et al., 2008), abstract relata involved in transitive reasoning (Prado, Noveck, & Van Der Henst, 2010), and other high-order cogni- tive sequences (Jubault, Ody, & Koechlin, 2007)."
"2659","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+175","A rival interpretation of the hIPS activation seen here is that participants mentally replaced algebraic variables with numer- als to solve the equivalence trials."
"2660","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+176","This strategy, however, is prone to error because it does not allow participants to unam- biguously order the three variables according to their magni- tude; the accurate performance seen in the equivalence task thus argues against a number-substitution interpretation."
"2661","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+177","We note that the use of hIPS might extend to ordering the constituents of complex sentences, which would explain the appearance of IPS (on the left side) among the regions revealed by our language contrast (and also in our earlier work on logical reasoning; Monti et al., 2009)."
"2662","Thought Beyond Language- Neural Dissociation of Algebra and Natural Language_2012_A+178","More research is needed on how the brain, and left and right IPS in particular, represents cardinal versus ordinal information (Cohen Kadosh, Muggleton, Silvanto, & Walsh, 2010; Nieder & Dehaene, 2009; Zago et al., 2008)."
